/*
 *  What is a normal surface?
 *
 *  Embedded surfaces will be described using normal surface theory.
 *  A given normal surface intersects each ideal tetrahedron in a (possibly
 *  empty) disjoint collection of topological squares and triangles.

 *  Each square cuts across the ideal tetrahedron as shown above, so as to
 *  separate the ideal tetrahedron's ideal vertices into two groups of two
 *  ideal vertices each.  There are three ways to do this, but a given ideal
 *  tetrahedron may contain squares of only one type, because the surface
 *  is embedded.

 *  Each triangle cuts across the ideal tetrahedron as shown above,
 *  so as to separate one ideal vertex from the other three.  There are
 *  four ways to do this, and triangles of all four types may be present
 *  simultaneously, because they don't intersect each other or the squares.
 *
 *
 *  How is a normal surface modelled in a Triangulation?
 *
 *  The squares and triangles are modelled in the Tetrahedron data structure
 *  as follows.  The field tet->parallel_edge contains the EdgeIndex
 *  (= 0, 1 or 2) of an edge which does not intersect the squares.  The
 *  opposite edge (= 5, 4 or 3, respectively) will lie on the opposite
 *  side of the squares, and all remaining edges will intersect the squares.
 *  The field tet->num_squares tells how many (parallel) squares lie in
 *  the Tetrahedron.  The fields tet->num_triangles[v] tell how many
 *  (parallel) triangles lie near the ideal vertex of VertexIndex v.
 *  When several surfaces must be available simultaneously, the parallel_edge,
 *  num_squares and num_triangles[] fields are copied to the corresponding
 *  fields of a NormalSurface structure (below).
