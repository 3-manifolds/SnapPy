To make the SnapPy application launchable from a Linux desktop, the
files in the share directory can be installed either in $HOME/.local/share
or in /usr/share.

The files consist of a .desktop file and icon files of various sizes in
.png format.  The .desktop file is used by the window manager uses to
recognize SnapPy as an application, and to know how to launch it.
Usually you have to logout and log back in before the application icon
will be recognized.

The snappy.desktop file needs to be adjusted for different Linux
distributions, according to where python setuptools installs the
SnapPy script.  So far I have observed:

Ubuntu 13.04     /usr/local/bin
Mandriva 2010    /usr/bin
Fedora 18        /usr/bin
