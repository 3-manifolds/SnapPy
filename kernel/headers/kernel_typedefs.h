 *  separate files (e.g. triangulation.h).
 *
 *  For C++ compatibility I've avoided definitions of the form

 *
 *  The problem with the former definition is that C++ insists on an
 *  explicit typecast to assign an integer to a variable of type Foo,
 *  so code like "for (foo = 0; foo < 2; foo++)" won't compile.

/*
 *  Gluings of ideal tetrahedra.
 *
 *  The neighbor and gluing fields of a Tetrahedron tell how the Tetrahedron
 *  is glued to the other Tetrahedra in the Triangulation.  The vertices of
 *  each Tetrahedron in the Triangulation are implicitly indexed by the integers
 *  {0,1,2,3}, and the faces are indexed according to the index of the opposite
 *  vertex.  The field tet->neighbor[i] contains a pointer to the Tetrahedron
 *  which face i of Tetrahedron tet glues to.  The field tet->gluing[i] describes
 *  the gluing as a Permutation of the set {0,1,2,3}, using the following scheme
 *  devised by Bill Thurston.  If j {j = 0,1,2,3} does not equal i, then j is the
 *  index of a vertex on face i of Tetrahedron tet, and the Permutation
 *  tet->gluing[i] applied to j gives the index of the vertex of Tetrahedron
 *  tet->neighbor[i] that vertex j glues to.  If j equals i, then j is the index
 *  of the vertex of Tetrahedron tet opposite face i, and the Permutation
 *  tet->gluing[i] applied to j gives the index of the vertex of Tetrahedron
 *  tet->neighbor[i] opposite the image of face i;  equivalently -- and more
 *  usefully -- j is the index of the given face on Tetrahedron tet, and the
 *  Permutation applied to j gives the index of its image face on
 *  tet->neighbor[i].
 *
 *  Each gluing field contains a permutation on {0,1,2,3}, represented in a
 *  single byte as follows.  The byte is conceptually divided into four two-bit
 *  fields.  The two high-order bits contain the image of 3 under the
 *  permutation, the next two bits contain the image of 2, etc.  So, for example,
 *  the permutation which takes 3210 to 2013 would be represented as 10000111.
 *  This representation is space-efficient, and also allows the definition of
 *  the following macro for evaluating permuations.

 *
 *  Note:  The fields x[h][v][v], which are not needed for storing
 *  the corner coordinates of triangles, are pressed into service in
 *  get_cusp_neighborhood_Ford_domain() to store the locations of the
 *  Ford domain vertices.  Cf. the FORD_VERTEX(h,v) macro below.
 *
 *  The Boolean field in_use[h][v] records which x[h][v][] fields
 *  are actually in use.  For a Klein bottle cusp, they all will be in use
 *  (because we work with the double cover).  For a torus cusp only half
