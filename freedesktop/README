To make the SnapPy application launchable from a Linux desktop, the
files in the share directory can be installed either in $HOME/.local/share.
For example, you could do this by running the command:

cp -rp share/* ~/.local/share

You should then be able to search for and launch the snappy application
and pin the SnapPy application icon to your gnome Dock or KDE Application
launcher.

The files consist of a .desktop file and icon files of various sizes in
.png format.  The .desktop file is used by the window manager uses to
recognize SnapPy as an application, and to know how to launch it.
Usually you have to logout and log back in before the application icon
will be recognized.

Modern linux systems, such as Ubuntu 24.04, no longer support installing
python packages with pip unless they are being installed in a venv.
The .desktop file assumes that you are using $HOME/venv as the name
of the venv that you used to install the snappy package with pip.
If that is incorrect then you will need to edit the Exec line in
snappy.desktop appropriately.
