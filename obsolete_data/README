This directory contains data files which have been removed
from the snappy manifolds directory.  They were used to
construct the new manifolds.sqlite file, using the now
obsolete SnapPy iterators:

OrientableCuspedCensus
OrientableClosedCensus
NonorientableCuspedCensus
NonorientableClosedCensus
LinkExteriors
CensusKnots

These have now been replaced by new iterators which are in the
module snappy.database.  The code for the obsolete iterators
remains in SnapPy.pyx (with some changes to make them independent
of the database).

The script make_db.py will rebuild the manifolds.sqlite file
using the data in this directory.  It overloads the new iterators
with the obsolete ones.

It is possible, if painful, to rebuild the database with no
database available to SnapPy.  There are three stages:

1. Run make_skeleton.py to build an empty database.
   Install this in snappy/manifolds and install the SnapPy package

2. Return here and run make_db.py.  It will build a much larger
   database, but will crash when it gets to the closed censuses.
   Move this larger database to snappy/manifolds and install
   the SnapPy package again.

3. Return here and run make_db.py a third time.  It will build the
   full database, which can be moved to snappy/manifolds for a final
   install of the SnapPy package.
