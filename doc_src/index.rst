What is SnapPy?
===============

    :align: right


SnapPy is a program for studying the topology and geometry of
3-manifolds, with a focus on hyperbolic structures.  It runs on Mac OS
X, Linux, and Windows, and combines a link editor and 3D-graphics for
Dirichlet domains and cusp neighborhoods with a powerful command-line
interface based on the Python_ programming language. You can see it
:doc:`in action<screenshots>`, learn how to :doc:`install<installing>`
it, and watch the :doc:`tutorial<tutorial>`.

News
====

* Version 3.0.3 (December 2021):

  - Runs natively on Macs with Apple Silicon processors (M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max).

* Version 3.0.2 (November 2021):
  
  - Support for SageMath 9.4 and 9.5, Python 3.10, and macOS Monterey.

* Version 3.0 (April 2021): New features include:

  - Incorporates Zoltán Szabó's `program
    <https://web.math.princeton.edu/~szabo/HFKcalc.html>`_ for
    computing Knot Floer homology, see :meth:`knot_floer_homology
    <spherogram.Link.knot_floer_homology>`.  This can compute the
    Seifert genus of a 25 crossing knot in mere seconds!

  - Topological slice obstructions of Herald-Kirk-Livingston, see
    :meth:`slice_obstruction_HKL <snappy.Manifold.slice_obstruction_HKL>`.

  - Faster "local" algorithm for :meth:`jones_polynomial
    <spherogram.Link.jones_polynomial>`.

  - `Cohomology fractals <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05840>`_ added to
    :meth:`inside_view <snappy.Manifold.inside_view>`.

  - Convention changes: Sign of knot signature (now positive knots have
    negative signatures), choice of braid generators (now positive
    generators give positive crossings).

  - Updates to methods :meth:`cusp_translations
    <snappy.Manifold.cusp_translations>`, :meth:`cusp_areas
    <snappy.Manifold.cusp_areas>`, :meth:`short_slopes
    <snappy.Manifold.short_slopes>`. Also :meth:`Link <spherogram.Link>`
    now accepts DT codes.

  - Support for SageMath 9.3, Python 3.9, and macOS Big Sur.

  - macOS app now code-signed and notarized.

  - SnapPy now requires Python 3.6 or newer.


* Version 2.8 (June 2020): New features include:

  - Raytraced interior views of a hyperbolic 3-manifold via the 
    :meth:`inside_view <snappy.Manifold.inside_view>` method, see also
    `images <https://im.icerm.brown.edu/portfolio/snappy-views/>`_ and
    `demo video <https://youtu.be/CAERhmUCkRs>`_.

  - :doc:`verify`: Several new features:

    * Complex volume (and thus the Chern-Simons invariant) for both
      cusped and closed manifolds, see
      :meth:`complex_volume <snappy.Manifold.complex_volume>`.
      
    * Disjoint cusp neighborhoods by the method :meth:`cusp_areas
      <snappy.Manifold.cusp_areas>` which uses
      :meth:`cusp_area_matrix <snappy.Manifold.cusp_area_matrix>`.

    * Cusp shapes (see :meth:`cusp_info <snappy.Manifold.cusp_info>`).
      
    * Finding all :meth:`short_slopes <snappy.Manifold.short_slopes>`
      in disjoint embedded cusp neighborhoods.

  - The census :class:`HTLinkExteriors <snappy.HTLinkExteriors>` has
    been extended to 15 crossing knots (contributed by Malik
    Obeidin).

  - The census :class:`CensusKnots <snappy.CensusKnots>` has been
    extended to triangulations with 9 ideal tetrahedra.

  - Support for SageMath 9.0 and macOS Catalina.

  - Development moved to `GitHub <https://github.com/3-manifolds>`_.
