/*
 *  edge_classes.c
 *
 *  This file provides the functions
 *
 *      void    create_edge_classes(Triangulation *manifold);
 *      void    replace_edge_classes(Triangulation *manifold);
 *      void    orient_edge_classes(Triangulation *manifold);
 *
 *  which are used within the kernel.
 *
 *  create_edge_classes() adds EdgeClasses to a partially
 *  constructed manifold which does not yet have them.
 *  It assumes the tet->neighbor and tet->gluing fields
 *  contain correct values.
 *
 *  replace_edge_classes() removes all EdgeClasses from a manifold
 *  and adds fresh ones.  replace_edge_classes() is typically called
 *  by functions which would rather replace invalid EdgeClasses
 *  at the end of an algorithm rather than try to maintain them
 *  as they go along.
 * 
 *  orient_edge_classes() orients a neighborhood of each EdgeClass.
 *  Relative to this orientation, each of the incident tetrahedra
 *  will be seen as right_ or left_handed.
 *
 *  The edges of a tetrahedron are indexed according to the following table:
 *
 *              lies     lies
 *       edge  between  between
 *              faces   vertices
 *        0      0,1      2,3
 *        1      0,2      1,3
 *        2      0,3      1,2
 *        3      1,2      0,3
 *        4      1,3      0,2
 *        5      2,3      0,1
 *
 *  orient_edge_classes() sets the field tet->edge_orientation[e] to be the
 *  orientation of Tetrahedron tet as seen by EdgeClass tet->edge_class[e].
 *  In an oriented manifold, all edge_orientations will be right_handed.
 *
 *  orient_edge_classes() should be called as soon as a Triangulation
 *  is created, and functions which modify a Triangulation should
 *  maintain the edge_orientation[] fields.
 *
 *  As explained in the documentation at the top of orient.c, orient()
 *  and orient_edge_classes() may be called in either order, but both
 *  should be called.
