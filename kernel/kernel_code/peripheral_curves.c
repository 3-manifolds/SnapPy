 *  peripheral_curves.c
 *
 *
 *  This file provides the function
 *
 *      void peripheral_curves(Triangulation *manifold);
 *
 *  which puts a meridian and longitude on each cusp.  If the
 *  manifold is oriented, the meridian and longitude adhere to
 *  the usual orientation convention;  this is, if you place your
 *  right hand on the torus with your fingers pointing in the
 *  direction of the meridian and your thumb pointing in the
 *  direction of the longitude, then your palm will face the
 *  cusp while the back of your hand faces the fat part of the
 *  manifold.  Note that this corresponds to the usual convention
 *  for orienting meridians and longitudes on link complements.
 *
 *  Even if the manifold isn't oriented, the peripheral curves
 *  adhere to the standard orientation convention relative to
 *  the orientation of each Cusp's orientation double cover (more
 *  on this below).
 *
 *  peripheral_curves() does not need to know the CuspTopology
 *  ahead of time.  It figures it out for itself and records the
 *  result in the field cusp->topology.
 *
 *  The remainder of this documentation will
 *
 *      (1) Define the meridian and the longitude.
 *
 *      (2) Describe the data structure used to store
 *          meridians and longitudes.
 *
 *      (3) Explain the algorithm which peripheral_curves()
 *          uses to find meridians and longitudes.
 *
 *
 *  (1) Definition of the meridian and the longitude.
 *
 *  The meridian and the longitude of an orientable cusp are
 *  any pair of simple closed curves which intersect exactly
 *  once.  If the manifold is orientable, they will adhere to
 *  the orientation convention described above.  peripheral_curves()
 *  finds meridians and longitudes which are reasonably short
 *  in the sense that they pass through a small number of
 *  triangles in the triangulation of the boundary torus.
 *
 *  The meridian and the longitude of a nonorientable cusp are
 *  defined more precisely.  There are exactly four nontrivial
 *  simple closed curves on a Klein bottle, up to isotopy.  I'd
 *  like to provide a picture of them, but, alas, there's no way
 *  to include a picture in an ASCII file, so I must ask you to
 *  draw your own picture as you read along.  Define the
 *  Klein bottle as a cylinder with ends glued.  Parameterize
 *  the cylinder by (x, theta), where -1 <= x <= +1 and theta
 *  is defined mod 2pi as for a circle.  To make the Klein
 *  bottle, identify the cylinder's ends via the mapping
 *  (-1, theta) -> (+1, -theta).  With this notation, the four
 *  simple closed curves on the Klein bottle are
 *
 *      A:  theta = 0
 *      B:  theta = pi
 *      C:  (theta = pi/2) U (theta = - pi/2)
 *      D:  x = 0
 *
 *  The longitude will be either curve A or curve B.  Thus,
 *  counting orientation, there are four possible longitudes.
 *  (Note:  as explained in section (2) immediately following,
 *  the longitude of a Klein bottle is actually stored as its
 *  preimage in the Klein bottle's double cover.)
 *  The meridian will be curve D.  Curve D cannot be oriented,
 *  because it's isotopic to its inverse.
 *
 *  The holonomies of the longitude and meridian of a Klein
 *  bottle have some very special properties, which are
 *  discussed in the comment at the top of holonomy.c.
 *
 *
 *  (2) How meridians and longitudes are stored.
 *
 *  The meridian and longitude are stored not on the boundary
 *  component itself, but on its orientation double cover.
 *  The double cover of a Klein bottle is a torus.  The double
 *  cover of a torus is the union of two tori, only one of
 *  which is actually used (the right_handed one, if the
 *  manifold is oriented).  The reason we want to always
 *  store curves on tori and never on Klein bottles directly
 *  is that the fundamental group of the torus is abelian:
 *  isotopy classes of curves can be recovered from homological
 *  information.  The reason only the right_handed sheet
 *  of the cover is used when the manifold is oriented is
 *  that the holonomy of a Dehn filling curve on the left_handed
 *  sheet is not a complex analytic function of the tetrahedron
 *  shapes, but rather the complex conjugate of such a function;
 *  we need complex analytic functions to compute the
 *  derivative matrix in the complex version of Newton's
 *  method used to find hyperbolic structures for oriented
 *  manifolds.
 *
 *  Each torus is the union of triangular cross sections of
 *  ideal vertices.  Each ideal vertex of each Tetrahedron
 *  contributes two triangles, one with the right_handed
 *  orientation and one with the left_handed orientation.
 *  Visualize the right-handed triangle as containing a
 *  counter-clockwise oriented circle, and the left-handed
 *  triangle as containing a clockwise-oriented circle, as viewed
 *  from infinity relative to the right_handed orientation of the
 *  Tetrahedron.  The triangles piece together so that orientations
 *  of neighboring circles agree:  if two neighboring Tetrahedra
 *  have opposite orientations, then the right_handed triangles
 *  of one connect with the left_handed triangles of the other;
 *  if the two tetrahedra have the same orientation, then the
 *  right_handed triangles of one match to the right_handed triangles
 *  of the other, and left_handed to left_handed.  Note that
 *  the components of the orientation double cover of the Cusps
 *  are all oriented, not just orientable (use the rule which
 *  says to view the circles so that all appear counterclockwise
 *  as seen from infinity).
 *
 *  The meridian and longitude are specified by their
 *  intersection numbers with the triangular cross sections.
 *  tet->curve[M][right_handed][v][f] is the net number of
 *  times the meridian crosses side f of the right_handed
 *  triangle at vertex v, and similarly for the
 *  longitude and the left_handed triangle.
 *  A positive intersection number means the curve is
 *  entering the triangle.  The sides of the triangle are
 *  numbered according to the faces of the tetrahedron
 *  containing them.  E.g., the sides of the triangle at
 *  vertex 2 will be numbered 0, 1 and 3.  The array vt_side[][]
 *  in tables.c lets you refer to the sides of a triangle by
 *  the integers 0, 1, 2, if this suits your purposes.
 *  Note that these intersection numbers are sufficient to
 *  reconstruct a simple closed curve up to isotopy.
 *
 *  The longitude of the Klein bottle is a special case in
 *  that its preimage in the double cover is connected.  It
 *  is stored as the complete preimage.  All other curves are
 *  stored as one component of their two-component preimages.
 *  By the way, the two candidates for the longitude (curves
 *  A and B in the discussion above) lift to the same curve in
 *  the double cover.
 *
 *
 *  (3) How peripheral_curves() finds the meridian and the
 *      longitude.
 *
 *  There are three main steps:
 *
 *      Compute a fundamental domain for the boundary component.
 *
 *      Identify it as a torus or Klein bottle.
 *
 *      Find the longitude and meridian.
 *
 *  The plan for finding a fundamental domain is
 *  conceptually simple:  initialize the domain as a single
 *  triangular vertex cross section, and then expand it outward
 *  by adding neighboring triangles in a breadth-first
 *  fashion, until the domain fills the entire cusp.
 *
 *  This plan is implemented with the PerimeterPiece data
 *  structure.  At each step, a circular linked list of
 *  PerimeterPieces defines the boundary of the domain.
 *  (Each PerimeterPiece corresponds to one edge of one
 *  triangle on the perimeter of the domain.)  The algorithm
 *  is to keep going around the perimeter, adding new
 *  PerimeterPieces as the domain expands across triangles
 *  which were not previously included.
 *
 *  While this process goes on, a second data structure is
 *  being created.  An array of 4 Extra fields attached to
 *  each tetrahedron (one Extra field for each vertex) records
 *
 *      (a) whether the vertex has been included in the domain,
 *
 *  and, if so,
 *
 *      (b) which other vertex (the "parent vertex") was
 *          responsible for including it.
 *
 *  The result is a tree structure, with the root at the
 *  original triangle and the leaves at the perimeter.  In
 *  a moment we'll see how this tree is used to create the
 *  longitudes and meridians.
 *
 *  Once the domain fills the entire cusp, we check whether
 *  there are any vertices of order one on the perimeter, and
 *  if so we remove them by cancelling the adjacent
 *  PerimeterPieces.
 *
 *  Conceptually (but NOT in the code) we imagine removing
 *  vertices of order two, thereby fusing the adjacent edges
 *  into one.  This must yield a fundamental domain which is
 *  either a square or a hexagon.  Here's the proof.  Assume
 *  a 2n-gon has pairs of sides glued so as to form a torus
 *  or a Klein bottle, and assume all vertices have order
 *  three or greater.  Since the 2n-gon itself has 2n vertices,
 *  there can be at most 2n/3 vertices in the resulting
 *  cell-decomposition of the torus or Klein bottle.
 *  Compute the Euler characteristic:
 *
 *      0 = Euler characteristic
 *        = vertices - edges + faces
 *       <= 2n/3 - n + 1
 *        = 1 - n/3
 *
 *      =>  n <= 3
 *      => the 2n-gon is a bigon, a square or a hexagon
 *
 *  A case-by-case analysis reveals that the only possible
 *  gluings are
 *
 *                  square      hexagon
 *                 ______________________
 *  torus         |  abAB   |   abcABC   |
 *                |---------+------------|
 *  Klein bottle  |  abAb   |   abcAcb   |
 *                |  aabb   |   aabccB   |
 *                 ----------------------
 *
 *  where the notation is what you would expect.  I wish I could
 *  provide an illustration of each gluing, but in platform-
 *  independent text file this just isn't possible.  So I ask
 *  that you make your own illustration of each gluing.
 *
 *  It is now straightforward to apply the definitions of the
 *  longitude and meridian to each gluing.  The details are
 *  spelled out in the documentation contained in the function
 *  find_meridian_and_longitude() and, especially, the functions
 *  it calls.
