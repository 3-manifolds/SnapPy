     *  (1) Think of the matrix as defining a face pairing isometry on

     *      fundamental group into the group of covering transformations.
     *      The isometry takes the mate to the given face.

     *  The formula for the Moebius transformation taking the a[] to the b[]
     *  is simple enough:
     *
     *  f(z) = [ (b1*k - b0) * z  +  (b0*a1 - b1*a0*k)] /
     *         [     (k - 1) * z  +  (a1 - k*a0)      ]

     *      k = [(b2-b0)/(b2-b1)] * [(a2-a1)/(a2-a0)]
     *
     *  Even though one of the a[] and/or one of the b[] could be infinite,
     *  we will bravely push forward with the computation.  The justification
     *  for such boldness is that the Complex constant Infinity is not actually
     *  infinite, but is just a large number (1e34).  Its square is less than
     *  the assumed value of DBL_MAX, so we can safely compute squares
     *  of "infinite" numbers and expect them to cancel properly with other
     *  infinite numbers.  In the normalization step we also assume the fourth
     *  power of "infinity" is less than DBL_MAX.  (DBL_MAX is 1.2e+4932
     *  on a Mac and 1.8e+308 on a Sun or NeXT, so we shouldn't run into
     *  trouble (knock on wood).)
     *
     *  It would be more rigorous to consider separately the cases with
     *  a0, a1 or a2; and/or b0, b1 or b2 are infinite, and take the limit of
     *  the above formula by hand, but I didn't feel up to it.
