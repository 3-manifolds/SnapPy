This directory contains data files which have been removed
from the snappy manifolds directory.  They were used to
construct the original manifolds.sqlite file, using the now
obsolete SnapPy iterators:

OrientableCuspedCensus
OrientableClosedCensus
NonorientableCuspedCensus
NonorientableClosedCensus
LinkExteriors
CensusKnots

These have now been replaced by new iterators which are loaded from
the module snappy.database.  The code for the obsolete iterators
remains in SnapPy.pyx (with some changes to make them independent of
the database, and with Obs preprended to the name).

The script make_db.py will rebuild the manifolds.sqlite database file
using the data stored in this directory.  This works even if
manifolds.sqlite is removed from snappy/manifolds.

The make_db.py script now builds a much larger database
more_manifolds.sqlite which contains all knots and links up to 14 crossings
as tabulated by Hoste-Thistlethwaite and Thistlethwaite.  This takes
a long time, and the script attempts to occupy all CPUs at 100%
to do the job.

The more_manifolds.sqlite database supercedes part of the
AlternatingKnots and NonalternatingKnots iterators, but they go through
16 crossings for knots.

IMPORTANT: The AlternatingKnots and NonalternatingKnots iterators use
a different numbering scheme than more_manifolds.sqlite.  In
more_manifolds.sqlite we were careful to use the same numbering as
is used in KnotInof and the Knot Atlas.
