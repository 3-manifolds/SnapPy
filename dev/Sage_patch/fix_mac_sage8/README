Sage patch kit for macOS
========================

August 8, 2019

The binary SageMath packages for macOS are not conveniently usable for
SnapPy users due to the fact that they do not provide working versions
of two standard Python modules which are needed to install and run
SnapPy.  The broken modules are pip and tkinter.  This "patch kit"
provides an easy way to make them work.

Quick Installation
==================

Open a Terminal window and run these commands:

cd /tmp
curl -O https://bitbucket.org/t3m/snappy/downloads/fix_mac_sage8.tgz
tar xvfz fix_mac_sage8.tgz
cd fix_mac_sage8
### Unless you already have a working version of Tk 8.6 installed, run:
open TclTk-8.6.10.pkg
### After you finish installing Tk, run
./FixMacSage8

Explanation
===========

The pip module, usually accessed via the command sage -pip, does not
work because it requires the Python ssl module which in turn requires
a Python extension module named _ssl.so, but the SageMath binary does
not include _ssl.so.  Moreover, SageMath does not provide any way to
build _ssl.so -- there is no sage spkg for the openssl library.

The tkinter module does not work because it requires a python
extension module named _tkinter.so which is not included in the
SageMath binary.  It is possible to build _tkinter.so by running the
command sage -f python2.  However, in recent versions of Sage, this
triggers recompilation of all components of SageMath, which can take
hours and effectively defeats the purpose of installing a binary
package in the first place.

Another issue with building _tkinter.so is that it is important to
have a working version of Tcl and Tk installed on the system before
doing so.  While macOS does include an installation of Tcl and Tk
(which will be deprecated in OSX 10.15 Catalina), that installation is
extremely out of date and does not really qualify as "working".

This patch kit contains a bash script named FixMacSage8 which will
install working versions of _ssl.so and _tkinter.so into your SageMath
installation without requiring any recompilation.  It will also
install working versions of Tcl and Tk 8.6 into /Library/Frameworks on
your mac.  NOTE: If you already have working versions of Tcl and Tk
8.6 you may simply close the package installer window which opens when
the script is first run.

Licensing
=========

Binary copies of the libraries libssl.1.1.dylib and libcrypto.1.1.dylib are
included in this kit.  These libraries are part of version 1.1.1 of openssl.
As such they are licensed under the dual OpenSSL and SSLeay license.  A copy
of that license is included in this kit as the file named
license-openssl-ssleay.txt The source code used to compiler these libraries
can be downloaded from:

https://www.openssl.org/source/

The included Tcl/Tk 8.6 package was built from source code which is subject to
the licensing terms described in the included file named tcltk_license.txt The
source code itself is available at:
