 *                      The Triangulation Algorithm
 *
 *
 *  Introduction
 *
 *  The triangulation algorithm is quite simple once you see the picture.
 *  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to include a sketch in an ASCII
 *  file, so you will need to sketch your own picture as I describe it.
 *  First thicken the link so that each component becomes a solid torus.
 *  Position it so that it lies near the equatorial 2-sphere in S^3.
 *  As I describe the vertices, edges, faces and 3-cells in the
 *  triangulation, try to draw them in your own picture.
 *
 *
 *  Vertices
 *
 *  Mark the solid tori (i.e. the link components) with
 *
 *  (1) a longitude which runs along the top of each component,
 *  (2) a longitude which runs along the bottom of each component,
 *  (3) a meridian which encircles the understrand at each crossing,
 *  (4) a meridian which encircles the overstrand at each crossing, and
 *  (5) a meridian located halfway between each pair of adjacent crossings.
 *
 *  These curves divide the surfaces of the solid tori into topological
 *  squares which will serve as the ideal vertices of the triangulation.
 *
 *  In addition, the initial triangulation will include two finite
 *  (i.e. non-ideal) vertices, one at the south pole of S^3 and one at
 *  the north pole.  (Don't worry -- we'll get rid of them at the end.)
 *  You should thicken these two finite vertices to become solid balls,
 *  for consistency with our picture of the link as a union of solid tori.
 *
 *
 *  Edges
 *
 *  The triangulation's edges are as follows.
 *
 *  (1) At each crossing of the link projection, there are edges running
 *
 *      (A) from the south pole of S^3 to the bottom of the understrand,
 *      (B) from the top of the understrand to the bottom of the overstrand,
 *      (C) from the top of the overstrand to the north pole of S^3.
 *
 *  (2) Midway between each pair of adjacent crossings, there are edges
 *
 *      (A) from the south pole of S^3 to the bottom of the link component,
 *      (B) from the top of the link component to the north pole of S^3.
 *
 *  (3) In the center of each region of the link projection there is an edge
 *
 *      (A) from the south pole to the north pole.
 *
 *
 *  Faces
 *
 *  There are three types of faces (2-cells).
 *
 *  (1) Triangular faces with edges of type (2A), (2B) and (3A).
 *      In your picture each such face will look like a topological hexagon,
 *      but only three of the edges are true edges of the triangulation.
 *      The other three "edges" are arcs on the boundary components:
 *      one arc is a half-meridian on a solid torus, another is an arc
 *      along the solid 3-ball at the north pole, and the last is an arc
 *      along the solid 3-ball at the south pole.
 *
 *  (2) Triangular faces with edges of type (1A), (1B) and (2A).
 *      As before, each face will look like a topological hexagon.
 *      In addition to the three real edges, there are three arcs on
 *      the boundary:  one runs along the bottom of the overstrand,
 *      a second is half a meridian encircling the understrand, and
 *      the last is an arc on the 3-ball at the south pole.
 *
 *  (3) Triangular faces with edges of type (1B), (1C) and (2B).
 *      These are just like the faces described in the previous paragraph,
 *      except that they are in the northern hemisphere instead of the
 *      southern hemisphere.
 *
 *  (4) Bigons with edges of type (1A) and (2A).  Each looks like a
 *      topological square, because it includes an arc running along
 *      the bottom of an understrand, and an arc on the 3-ball at the
 *      south pole.
 *
 *  (5) Bigons with edges of type (1C) and (2B).  These are just like
 *      the bigons in the previous paragraph, only they connect the
 *      overstrand to the north pole, rather than connecting the
 *      understrand to the south pole.
 *
 *  So . . . you should draw all the 2-cells of the above types wherever
 *  they make sense.  (I'm hoping your understanding of what "makes sense"
 *  is clearer than any longwinded explanation I could provide.)
 *
 *
 *  3-cells
 *
 *  The 2-cells described above divide the link complement into 3-cells.
 *  The 3-cells are all identical to one another, and four of them surround
 *  each crossing.  (So in particular the number of 3-cells is exactly
 *  four times the number of crossings.)  Each 3-cell has six real faces
 *  (two of type (1) and one each of types (2), (3), (4) and (5) described
 *  in the preceding section), as well as four square pieces of the
 *  manifold's boundary (one on the understrand, one on the overstrand,
 *  one on the 3-ball at the south pole and one on the 3-ball at the north
 *  pole).
 *
 *  At this point, our cell decomposition fails to be an ideal triangulation
 *  for two reasons:
 *
 *  (1) The 3-cells aren't tetrahedra.
 *
 *  (2) The vertices at the north and south pole are finite, not ideal.
 *
 *  The following section on Shrinking Away Bigons resolves problem (1),
 *  and then the section on Removing Finite Vertices resolves problem (2).
 *
 *
 *  Shrinking Away Bigons
 *
 *  We can get rid of the bigons simply by shrinking them away!
 *  Each is a rectangle with two real edges as well as two arcs on the
 *  boundary.  Shrink the arcs on the boundary to zero length.  This
 *  merges the two real edges into a single edge, and the bigon disappears.
 *
 *      Essential Assumption:  Each link component has at least one
 *      overcrossing and at least one undercrossing.
 *
 *  The Essential Assumption guarantees that the two real edges being
 *  merged are always distinct.  If the Essential Assumption were false,
 *  you'd have a circular chain of bigons.  You could shrink all but one
 *  of the bigons, but when you went to shrink the last one you'd find
 *  its two real edges were actually the same edge, so you couldn't shrink
 *  away the bigon without changing the topology of the manifold.
 *
 *  make_all_components_have_crossings() adds a nugatory crossing to each
 *  link component which doesn't already have both under- and overcrossings,
 *  so the Essential Assumption will always be satisfied.
 *
 *  Once we've shrunk away all bigons, each 3-cell (which originally
 *  had six faces -- two bigons and four triangles) is left with only
 *  the four triangular faces.  Furthermore, shrinking the bigons
 *  collapses each square region on the manifold's boundary (i.e. on
 *  the tubular neighborhood of the link and on the 3-balls at the
 *  north and south poles) to a trianglar region.  In other words,
 *  each 3-cell has become an ideal tetrahedron.
 *
 *  Computational note:  The computer code never explicitly deals with
 *  bigons.  It simply sets up the correct gluings on the triangular faces,
 *  ignores the bigons, and everything comes out right!
 *
 *
 *  Removing Finite Vertices
 *
 *  This is easy.  We just call SnapPea's remove_finite_vertices() function.
 *  Please see the file finite_vertices.c for extensive documentation
 *  of the finite vertex removal algorithm.
 *
 *
 *  March 1997.  If the link projection is obviously disconnected,
 *  triangulate_link_complement() now does a trivial type II Reidemeister
 *  move to make it connected.  Similarly, if there are obvious unknotted
 *  components, it adds nugatory crossings.  As a result, it can now
 *  triangulate the complements of ALL link projections.
 *  (The original design of storing the LCCrossings on a fixed array
 *  is no longer so nice now that we sometimes have to add crossings.
 *  Fortunately we add crossings only in rare circumstances.)
