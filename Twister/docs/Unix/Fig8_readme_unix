Here are several ways to build the complement of the figure eight knot 
in the three-sphere using the surface programs generated by Twister. In
each case the file named in angle brackets must be replaced by the actual
path to that file (relative to twisters current location).

	Twister.out -f <S_0_4.sur> -s "z*z*Y*Y" -h "a*B" 

This command builds a two-bridge presentation of the figure eight
knot. We start with the surface S_{0,4}, attach two-handles above the
loop a and below the loop b and finally perform four half twists on
neighbourhoods of the rectangles z and y.

	Twister.out -f <S_0_4.sur> -s "z*z*A" -h "a*B"

Performs the same actions as before except this time we do a pair of
half twists on a neighbourhood of the rectangle z and one Dehn twist
about the annulus a.

	Twister.out -f <S_0_6.sur> -s "z*Y*z*Y" -h "a*A*b*B" 

Using S_{0,6} as the Heegaard surface, this gives the figure eight
knot as the closure of a three-strand braid. In detail: take S_{0,6}
as the Heegaard surface, attach two-handles above and below the loops
a and b and perform half twists on neighbourhoods of the rectangles z
and y.

	Twister.out -f <S_1_1.sur> -b "A*b"

Build a surface bundle over the circle with fibre S_{1,1} and then
perform 2 Dehn twists, a negative one on the annulus about a and then
a positive one on the annulus about b.

	Twister.out -f <S_2_heeg.sur> -s "!e" -h "a*b*C*D" 

Build a Heegaard splitting over the surface S_{2}, attach two handles
above a and b and below c and d and finally drill out a neighbourhood
of the loop e. Here the loop e is the figure eight knot as it lies on
the standard genus two splitting of S3.

	Twister.out -f <heeg_fig8.sur> -s "" -h "a*b*C"

Build a Heegaard splitting of the figure eight knot complement. The
file describes the handle structure coming from the handlebody/
compression body decomposition of the manifold. This is derived from
the upper tunnel for the two-bridge presentation.

	Twister.exe -f <S_0_5.sur> -s "!v*!y*!w*!z*!x" -h "a*b*c*d*e*A*B*C*D*E" 

Build a Heegaard splitting over the surface S_{0,5} with a carefully 
chosen generating set such that drilling the rectangles (in this 
order) after capping each cusp above and below is the complement of 
the figure eight knot in the three-sphere.

Remarks: 

Any two-bridge link can be built using the command:

	Twister.out -f <S_0_4.sur> -s <gluing> -h "a*B" 

with appropriate sequence of (half) twists <gluing>.

All possible three-braid closures can be built using the commmand:

	Twister.out -f <S_0_6.sur> -s <gluing> -h "a*A*b*B"

The same program can be used to build three-bridge links.

Building the 8_15 knot:

The 8_15 knot is a hyperbolic three-bridge knot, but not a
two-bridge knot. Hence it can be built, for example, using the command:

	Twister.out -f <S_0_6.sur> -s "V*V*z*y*x*w*v*x*W*v*x*w*v*w*z" -h "a*A*b*B" 

but cannot be built with the command:

	Twister.out -f <S_0_4.sur> -s <gluing> -h "a*B"

for any <gluing>.
