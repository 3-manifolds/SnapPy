SnapPea Unix Kit

This directory provide some files which make it easy
to call SnapPea functions from within your own C programs.

(1)  unix_sample_main.c provides a sample main(),
     which you can modify to suit your purposes.

(2)  unix_file_io.c provides the functions

	   Triangulation	*get_triangulation(char *file_name);
       void				save_triangulation(Triangulation *manifold, char *file_name);

     for use in your own main().  You needn't modify (or even
     look at) this file.

(3)  unix_UI.c provides a set of functions through which
     the SnapPea kernel can pass messages to the user.
     You needn't modify (or even look at) this file.

If you have questions, please contact me at weeks@geom.umn.edu.
