//			SnapPea 2.0 Link Projection File Format
//
//	This document explains SnapPea 2.0's file format for storing
//	link projections.  The link projections are written as text-
//	only files, to allow easy cross-platform file transfers, and
//	also to make it easy for other computer programs to create
//	link projection files.
//
//	This document contains an annotated link projection file.
//	If you remove all comments (i.e. remove all text preceded by
//	a double slash) you'll be left with a SnapPea-readable link
//	projection file.
//
//	This sample file describes the Hopf link.

//	The horizontal axis runs left-to-right (as you would expect),
//	but the vertical axis runs top-to-bottom (as you may or may
//	not expect, depending on what window system you're used to).
//	The square's corner coordinates are at multiples of 50.
//
//	Although this simple example doesn't illustrate it, the
//	file format allow "unfinished" link components.  That is,
//	some or all of the link components may be topological
//	intervals instead of topological circles.  Indeed, a link
//	component may consist of a single vertex.  Morever, the
//	format allows for a "hot vertex".  The hot vertex is the
//	vertex (if any) which the link editor will join to the next
//	point the user clicks.
//
//	The file format doesn't require general position, but SnapPea's
//	triangulation algorithm does.  To keep it happy, please don't
//	let edges pass through other vertices (they can come as close
//	as they want) and don't let crossings get too close to one
//	another (their coordinates will be rounded to integer values,
//	and in any case human viewers will appreciate having crossings
//	stay at least a half dozen pixels away from one another).
//	(As you may have guessed, the coordinates are pixel coordinates.)
//
//	Now on to a line-by-line description of the file . . .

//	Every link projection file begins with the following line.
//	This tells SnapPea what file type to expect (link projection,
//	triangulation, or generators).

% Link Projection

//	Components
//
//	The '2' (see below) means this link has two components.
//
//	The components are numbered implicitly, beginning at 0.
//	For each component, there is a line giving the indices of
//	the component's first and last vertices.  For a circular
//	component the first and last vertex will be the same, and
//	may be any vertex in the component.  For a linear component
//	the first and last vertices will be the endpoints.
//	So, in this example, we see that
//
//		component 0 begins and ends at vertex 0, and 
//		component 1 begins and ends at vertex 4.

//	Vertices
//
//	The '8' means that this example has 8 vertices.
//
//	The vertices are numbered implicitly, beginning at 0.
//	For each vertex, there is a line giving the vertex's
//	coordinates.  In this example,
//
//		vertex 0 is at ( 50,  50)
//		vertex 1 is at (150,  50)
//		...
//		vertex 7 is at (100, 200)
//
//	Recall that the vertical axis (the second coordinate) is
//	directed top-to-bottom.

//	Edges
//
//	The next '8' means that this example has 8 edges.
//
//	The edges are numbered implicitly, beginning at 0.
//	For each edge, there is a line giving the indices of the
//	edge's endpoints.  In this example,
//
//		edge 0 runs from vertex 0 to vertex 1
//		edge 1 runs from vertex 1 to vertex 2
//		...
//		edge 7 runs from vertex 7 to vertex 4
//
//	All edges are directed, so the order of the vertices
//	is important.

//	Crossings
//
//	The following '2' means that this example has 2 crossings.
//
//	For each crossing, there is a line giving the indices of the
//	underedge and the overedge.  In this example
//
//		edge 2 passes under edge 7
//		edge 4 passes under edge 1

//	If there is a "hot vertex" (cf. above) its index is given here.
//	If there is no hot vertex, a -1 appears here.
//	In this example, there is no hot vertex.  (Indeed, a hot vertex
//	makes sense only when it's the endpoint of a linear component.)

-1

//	Technical note:  Just because a component has the same first
//	and last vertex, you can't conclude that it's a circular
//	component.  It could be a component consisting of a single
//	vertex and no edges.

//	The end.
