What is SnapPy?
==================

SnapPy is a program for studying the topology and geometry of
3-manifolds, with a focus on hyperbolic structures.  
It runs on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows, and combines a link editor and 3D-graphics
for Dirichlet domains and cusp neighborhoods with a powerful
command-line interface based on the `Python <http://python.org>`_
programming language. You can see it `in action <screenshots.html>`_,
learn how to `install <installing.html>`_ it, and watch the `tutorial
<tutorial.html>`_.   

News
============

* Version 2.5 (Feb 2017): New features include:

  - Rigorous computation of `hyperbolic volume
    <manifold.html#snappy.Manifold.volume>`_.

  - STL export of Dirichlet domains for 3D printing, contributed by
    Jose Sanchez.

  - Support for Python 3, SageMath 7.5 and 7.6, and many more versions of
    Python on Windows.

  - Much improved infrastructure for testing and distributing SnapPy.

* `Complete version history <news.html>`_.
