
Twister 2.0 loads the required information about a surface from a
surface file. Here we describe the format of surface files.

First, an example:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# S_{1,1}
2#
annulus,a,A,-0#
annulus,b,B,+0,-1#
rectangle,x,X,+1#
macro,y,Y,a*B#
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Each line of the surface file ends in a "#" and any text written after
this is discarded. Thus comments may be added after "#". All white
space is silently dropped.

The first non-comment line of the file must contain the number of
squares needed to build the surface.

Next is a list of annuli, rectangles and macros in which all data 
is comma-separated and the last datum is followed by a "#".

1) Each must begin with the word "annulus", "rectangle" or "macro". 
Note that macros are ignored by Twister and can be expanded by the 
Twister Python interface script Twister.py.

2) Next is the name and inverse name, used, in the case of annuli and 
rectangles, to tell Twister to perform a left or a right twist 
respectively. Names may consists of alpha-numerics and underscores 
only. All names must be unique.

3a) (Annuli and rectangles) Last is a sequence of squares, with 
orientations. A sequence of squares may continue over multiple lines 
until terminated with a "#".

3b) (Macros) Last is a command that the name should be expanded into.
The inverse name will be expanded into the inverse of this command which
will be determined when needed.

Surface files can be built automatically using the included Python
script "surface_generator.py". For example,

"python surface_generator.py 2 1"

writes the following output to the file LP_S_2_1.sur.

# Paris' paper "Presentations for the punctured mapping class groups
# in terms of Artin groups".

annulus,b_3,B_3,-4,+5#
