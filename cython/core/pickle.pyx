# Cython functions for pickling and unpickling Triangulations
#
# The functions pickle_triangulation and unpickle triangulation
# perform fairly straightforward serialization and deserialization of
# the kernel's TriangulationData structure, via Python bytes objects.
#
# For complete orientable manifolds, this process preserves all
# combinatorial properties of the triangulation, including the
# orderings of the tetrahedra and of the vertices in each tetrahedron
# as well as the normal curve description of the peripheral curves.
# (The peripheral curves are not preserved for manifolds which are not
# orientable or not complete.)
#
# These functions are limited to manifolds with at most 2^15 - 1
# tetrahedra and at most 255 cusps.  Also, the normal coordinates for
# the peripheral curves are assumed to be in the interval [-128, 127]
#
# Note that the byte sequences produced by pickle_triangulation
# are very likely to contain null bytes, so care must be taken
# in the code when converting between Python and C strings.
