 *  triangulation_io.h
 *
 *  The question of file formats is tricky. Typically an application has a
 *  different file format for each platform it runs on (Mac, Windows, etc.),
 *  perhaps with some support for translating between them.  Certainly
 *  the easiest way to write Macintosh SnapPea would have been to use
 *  the THINK Class Library's built-in file handling capabilities:
 *  file i/o would have been trivial to program, and each kind of file
 *  (triangulation, generators, link projection) would have its own
 *  "file type" and icon.  However, I chose to use straight ASCII text
 *  files for the following reasons:
 *
 *  (1) The files can be read and written on any platform.
 *      For example, a Mac user can send a Triangulation file
 *      to a friend using a unix version of SnapPea.
 *
 *  (2) Human beings can read the files using any text editor.
 *
 *  (3) Text-only files are best for people doing other programming
 *      projects which use SnapPea's manifolds as input.  (Again,
 *      people do this work on a variety of platforms.)
 *
 *  On the other hand, I think it would be a mistake to hard-code the
 *  SnapPea kernel to read data from unix-style FILEs.  When the UI
 *  reads a triangulation file, it passes the data to the kernel using
 *  the data structures defined below.  And, of course, when the UI wants
 *  to write a triangulation to a file, it requests the data from the
 *  kernel in this same format.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *
 *  (1) This format is similar to that of the Triangulation data structure.
 *      However, the present format is available to the UI, while
 *      the Triangulation data structure is private to the kernel.
 *
 *  (2) The new file format is not backward compatible to the old
 *      file format, although they are similar.  (I couldn't keep
 *      the old file format because it doesn't work properly with
 *      nonorientable manifolds.)  SnapPea 2.0 will read (but not write)
 *      the old file format, with the exception that peripheral curves
 *      on nonorientable manifolds are recomputed from scratch.
 *
 *  (3) If you (or your program) is writing TriangulationData structures
 *      from scratch, note that not all fields are required.  The fields
 *      solution_type, volume, and the TetrahedronDatas' filled_shapes
 *      are ignored by data_to_triangulation(), because it recomputes the
 *      hyperbolic structure from scratch.  The meridian and longitude
 *      are optional:  if you provide them, data_to_triangulation()
 *      will use them;  otherwise it provides a default basis.
 *      (In the latter case, of course, you shouldn't specify any
 *      Dehn fillings, because you aren't providing the basis relative
 *      to which they are defined.)
 *
 *      96/9/17  If you set both num_or_cusps and num_nonor_cusps to zero,
 *      data_to_triangulation() will create the Cusps for you.  It will
 *      also create the peripheral curves.
 *
 *      96/9/17  If you specify unknown_orientability, data_to_triangulation()
 *      will attempt to orient the manifold.  This will typically change
 *      the indexing of the Tetrahedra's vertices.
