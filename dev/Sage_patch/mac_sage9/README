This python module fixes the Sage 9 distribution so as to make the
tkinter and ssl modules work.  (The ssl module is used by pip.)  It
runs an installer which installs Tk 8.6.10 in /Library/Frameworks
and adds some missing libraries to Sage.  You will need to run
the Sage 9 python interpreter to make the patch.  For example,
if you have installed Sage 9 in your applications folder you
would change to the directory containing the mac_sage9 directory
which contains this README file and run:

/Applications/SageMath-9.0.app/sage -python -m mac_sage9.fix
