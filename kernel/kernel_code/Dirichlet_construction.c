 *  Dirichlet_construction.c
 *
 *  The Dirichlet domain code is divided among several files.  The header
 *  file Dirichlet.h explains the organization of the three files, and
 *  provides the common definitions and declarations.
 *
 *  This file provides the function
 *
 *      WEPolyhedron *compute_Dirichlet_domain( MatrixPairList  *gen_list,
 *                                              double          vertex_epsilon);
 *
 *  compute_Dirichlet_domain() computes the Dirichlet domain defined by
 *  the list of generators, and sets the list of generators equal to
 *  the face pairings of the Dirichlet domain, sorted by order of increasing
 *  image height (see Dirichlet_basepoint.c for the definition of "image
 *  height").  It does not set certain cosmetic fields (vertex->ideal, etc.)
 *  which aren't needed for the computation;  it assumes the calling
 *  function will set them at the very end (cf. bells_and_whistles() in
 *  Dirichlet_extras.c).  If compute_Dirichlet_domain() fails (as explained
 *  immediately below) it returns NULL.
 *
 *  Error detection.  No Dirichlet domain algorithm can be perfect.
 *  If you give it, say, the generators for a (p,q) Dehn surgery on the
 *  figure eight knot, then it will surely fail for large enough p and q,
 *  because the true Dirichlet domain will have a vast number of tiny
 *  faces, and the numerical precision of the underlying hardware won't
 *  be good enough to resolve them all correctly.  The present algorithm
 *  will attempt to resolve the faces as best it can, but will return
 *  NULL if it fails.  Its strategy is to start with a cube and intersect
 *  it with appropriate half planes, one at a time.  At each step it checks
 *  how the slicing plane intersects the existing polyhedron.  Vertices
 *  lying very close to the slicing plane are assumed to lie on it (the
 *  precise interpretation of "very close" is defined by vertex_epsilon).
 *  Each edge passing from one side of the slicing plane to the other is
 *  divided in two by introducing a new vertex at the point where the edge
 *  intersects the slicing plane.  Similarly, each face which passes through
 *  the slicing plane is divided in two.  The program then checks rigorously
 *  that the slicing plane divides the surface of the polyhedron into two
 *  combinatorial disks.  If it does, the vertices, edges and faces on
 *  the "far" side of the slicing plane are discarded, a new face is
 *  introduced, and we know for sure that the surface of the polyhedron
 *  is still a combinatorial ball.  If the slicing plane does not divide
 *  the surface of the polyhedron into two combinatorial disks (as could
 *  happen when the vertices are so close together that roundoff error
 *  introduces inconsistent combinatorial relations), the program gives up
 *  and returns NULL.
 *
 *  The basic approach of the algorithm is to first use the given generators
 *  to find a polyhedron which
 *
 *  (1) is a superset of the true Dirichlet domain, and
 *
 *  (2) does not extend beyond the sphere at infinity.
 *
 *  Once it has such a polyhedron, it checks whether the faces match correctly.
 *  If they all do, it's done.  Otherwise it uses the pairs of nonmatching
 *  faces to find new group elements which are guaranteed to slice off at
 *  least one vertex of the candidate polyhedron.  In this way it is guaranteed
 *  to arrive at the true Dirichlet domain in a finite (and typically small)
 *  number of steps.  The algorithm is described in more detail in the code
 *  itself.
 *
 *  For closed manifolds the algorithm works quickly and reliably.  For
 *  large cusped manifolds, computing a candidate polyhedron satisfying
 *  (1) and (2) above is a bottleneck.  I hope to eventually find a quicker
 *  way to compute it.
 *
 *  The Dirichlet domain algorithm uses matrices in O(3,1). Despite their
 *  many theoretical advantages, they lead to rapidly accumulating numerical
 *  errors when the manifold is at all large (see Dirichlet_precision.c for
 *  a more detailed discussion of the problem).  Occasionally the algorithm will
 *  encounter topological inconsistencies and fail, and will return NULL.
 *  Fortunately the problem can usually be corrected.  The root of the problem
 *  is the need to decide whether two closely spaced vertices should be
 *  interpreted as distinct vertices of the Dirichlet domain, or as two images
 *  of a single vertex, differing only by roundoff error.  The decision is
 *  guided by the value of the vertex_epsilon parameter.  Use a small value
 *  (e.g. 1e-12) to compute Dirichlet domains with many small faces, e.g. a
 *  (100,1) Dehn surgery on the figure eight knot.  Use a larger value when
 *  computing simple Dirichlet domains for larger manifolds.  (Larger manifolds
 *  tend to have less accurately defined face pairings, due to the numerical
 *  problems in O(3,1).)  The most extreme vertex resolution values (say less
 *  than 1e-16 or more than 1e-2) usually fail, so try to stay within that
 *  range unless you're really desperate.
 *
 *  Technical note:  the WEPolyhedron's num_vertices, num_edges and num_faces
 *  fields are not maintained during the construction, but are set at the end.
 *
 *  By the way, compute_Dirichlet_domain() assumes no nontrivial group element
 *  fixes the origin.  In other words, it assumes that the basepoint does not
 *  lie in an orbifold's singular set.  Dirichlet_from_generators_with_displacement()
 *  in Dirichlet.c makes sure that doesn't happen.

     *
     *  Proposition.  The following are equivalent.
     *
     *  (1) The hyperplanes defined by f0 and f1 are equal.
     *
     *  (2) f0(origin) = f1(origin)
     *
     *  (3) f0(f0(origin)) = origin

     *  (4)     f0 is a half turn about an axis which passes orthogonally
     *              through the midpoint of the segment connecting the
     *              origin to f0(origin).
     *      or

     *              through the midpoint of the segment connecting the
     *              origin to f0(origin).
     *      or
     *          f0 is a reflection through the midpoint of the segment
     *              connecting the origin to f0(origin).
     *
     *  (5) f0 = f1
     *
     *  Proof.  Throughout this proof, keep in mind that we first gave the
     *  basepoint a small random displacement, and then perhaps moved it
     *  towards a point of maximum injectivity radius, so we may assume
     *  that its images under the covering transformation group are distinct.
     *
     *  (1 => 2).  Obvious.
     *
     *  (2 => 3).  f0(f0(origin)) = f0(f1(origin)) = origin, because
     *  f0 and f1 are inverses of one another.
     *
     *  (3 => 4).  f0 interchanges the origin and f0(origin).  Therefore
     *  if fixes the midpoint M of the segment S connecting the origin
     *  to f0(origin).  Furthermore, the plane P which passes through
     *  M and is orthogonal to S will be taken to itself (setwise, but
     *  probably not pointwise).  Consider the possibilities for the
     *  action of f0 on P.
     *
     *  Case 1.  f0 preserves the orientation of hyperbolic 3-space, and
     *  therefore reverses the orientation of P.  Because f0 fixes the
     *  point M, it must act on P as a reflection in some line L which
     *  contains M and is contained in P.  It follows that f0 acts on
     *  hyperbolic 3-space as a half turn about the line L.
     *
     *  Case 2.  f0 reverses the orientation of hyperbolic 3-space, and
     *  therefore preserves the orientation of P.  Because f0 fixes the
     *  point M, it must act on P as a rotation about M through some angle
     *  theta.  This implies that f0^2 acts on hyperbolic 3-space as a
     *  rotation about the line containing S through an angle 2*theta.
     *  But the nondegenerate choice of basepoint (cf. the comments at the
     *  beginning of this proof) implies that 2*theta = 0 (mod 2pi).
     *  So theta = 0 or pi (mod 2pi).  If theta = 0, f0 acts on hyperbolic
     *  3-space as a reflection in the plane P.  If theta = pi, f0 acts on
     *  hyperbolic 3-space as a reflection in the point M.
     *
     *  (4 => 5).  In each of the three cases lists (half turn about axis,
     *  reflection in plane, reflection in point) f0 is its own inverse.
     *  Therefore f0 = f1.
     *
     *  (5 => 1).  Trivial.

     *  Proof.  check_topology_of_cut() insures that the cut locus is a

     *  closed curve divides the surface of a 2-sphere into two disks.

     *  (1) all positive vertices,
     *  (2) all edges incident to at least one positive vertex, and
     *  (3) all faces incident to at least one positive vertex,

     *  be a combinatorial ball.
     *
     *  Proof.  This is almost obvious as a corollary of the above
     *  proposition.  We just need to verify that conditions (1)-(3)
     *  characterize the vertices, edges and face in the interior of
     *  the positive Schoenflies disk.
     *
     *  (1) We've already seen that all interior vertices must be positive.
     *
     *  (2) An interior edge can't have two vertices on the boundary of the
     *      Schoenflies disk, because if it did it would be a 0-edge and
     *      would be part of the cut locus.  Therefore at least one vertex
     *      is positive.
     *
     *  (3) If all the vertices of a given face were 0-vertices, its
     *      boundary would have to be the entire cut locus, and no vertices
     *      could exist in its interior.  This would contradict the

     *  first do alpha, then do group_element.)

     *  Let V be the vertex in question -- the vertex of face which lies

     *
     *      distance(V, origin) = distance(V, group_element(origin))

     *      distance(V, group_element(origin)) > distance(V, beta(origin))
     *
     *          because V lies beyond that side of the image of the mate.

     *  Combining the above two observations yields

     *      distance(V, origin) > distance(V, beta(origin))

     *  Technical digression.
     *
     *      The old version of SnapPea used a "clever trick" to check that
     *      a face is a subset of its mate.  I've chosen not to use that
     *      trick here, and in this digression I will briefly explain why.
     *      Feel free to skip this digression is you want.  I'm writing it
     *      mainly for my own good, so if I come back a few years from now
     *      and wonder why I didn't use the trick, I'll at least know what
     *      I was thinking at the time.
     *
     *      The "clever trick" was to try to simultaneously traverse the
     *      perimeters of the face and its mate, checking that the group
     *      element beta (defined above) is already the group element
     *      corresponding to one of the face's neighbors.  If this didn't
     *      work, either because the faces didn't in fact match up, or
     *      (less likely) because the edges weren't of order 3, then the
     *      old code would fall back to an algorithm like the one described
     *      above.
     *
     *      I've chosen not to use this "clever trick" in the present code
     *      for the following reasons.
     *
     *      (1) For nonorientable manifolds, the code would get messier
     *          because we wouldn't know a priori which way we need to
     *          traverse the faces.
     *
     *      (2) The code wasn't that much more efficient to begin with.
     *          To match two n-gons, it would have to do n matrix
     *          multiplications.  Each matrix multiplication requires
     *          about 4^3 operations, so the run time is about O(n * 4^3).
     *          The simpler algorithm (the one used here) requires, in
     *          addition, the computation of n^2 inner products, to
     *          check whether each of n points lies on the correct side
     *          of n hyperplanes.  This requires a time O(n^2 * 4).
     *          At first glance O(n^2) looks worse than O(n), but we
     *          have to remember that n is not a large number.  One can
     *          prove that for a typical polyhedron, the average value
     *          of n is around 6.  (For an atypical polyhedron it's even
     *          less.)  So the simpler algorithm requires little additional
     *          time.  Indeed, if one wanted to streamline it, once could
     *          compute only the first column of beta, unless it turned
     *          out that you needed the whole matrix to add a new face.
     *          So the simpler algorithm might be even faster.
     *
     *      (3) Whether the old algorithm is faster than the new one isn't
     *          completely clear, but given that the run times will be
     *          similar, I feel that the simplicity of the code should
     *          be the top priority.
     *
     *  End of technical digression.
