To build twister as a Python package use the command:
	python setup.py build
Note that after doing this you will need to add ./build/lib.*-2.7/ to the 
PYTHONPATH manually.

Note: on Solaris the CC environment variable must first be set to "CC" by
using the command:
	setenv CC CC

To install twister as a Python package (which will probably require a lot
of privilege) use the command:
	python setup.py install

Then, from within Python the twister module can now be imported using:
	import twister
The most key features of this are the functions twister.twister and 
twister.get_surface

To test that the features of Twister 2.0 are working, run the Python test 
suite by using the command:
	python setup.py test

This will build several knot complements using a variety of different 
methods and check some peripheral curves give expected Dehn fillings. The 
final result should be:

Checking: 9_31
===PASS===
Words to check: 160
Checking: BBBB
===PASS===
Words to check: 910
Checking: EEE
===PASS===
Checking: 6,8,14,18,16,4,-20,10,2,-12
===PASS===


Overall Result: PASS


To compile Twister 2.0 as a standalone program using the provided makefile, 
simply navigate to this folder in a terminal and run the command:
	make

To compile Twister 2.0 manually using g++ (or in any equivalent C++ compiler)
in Windows use the command:
	g++ -o Twister.exe ./lib/kernel/*.cpp -D OS_ENVIRONMENT=0 -W -Wall
and on UNIX systems:
	g++ -o Twister.out ./lib/kernel/*.cpp -D OS_ENVIRONMENT=1 -W -Wall
