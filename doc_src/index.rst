What is SnapPy?
===============

    :align: right


SnapPy is a program for studying the topology and geometry of
3-manifolds, with a focus on hyperbolic structures.  It runs on Mac OS
X, Linux, and Windows, and combines a link editor and 3D-graphics for
Dirichlet domains and cusp neighborhoods with a powerful command-line
interface based on the Python_ programming language. You can see it
:doc:`in action<screenshots>`, learn how to :doc:`install<installing>`
it, and watch the :doc:`tutorial<tutorial>`.

News
====

* Version 2.8 (May 2020): New features include:

  - Raytraced interior views of a hyperbolic 3-manifold via the 
    :meth:`inside_view <snappy.Manifold.inside_view>` method, see also
    `images <https://im.icerm.brown.edu/portfolio/snappy-views/>`_ and
    `demo video <https://youtu.be/CAERhmUCkRs>`_.

  - :doc:`verify`: Several new features:

    * Complex volume (and thus the Chern-Simons invariant) for both
      cusped and closed manifolds, see
      :meth:`complex_volume <snappy.Manifold.complex_volume>`.
      
    * Disjoint cusp neighborhoods by the method :meth:`cusp_areas
      <snappy.Manifold.cusp_areas>` which uses
      :meth:`cusp_area_matrix <snappy.Manifold.cusp_area_matrix>`.

    * Cusp shapes (see :meth:`cusp_info <snappy.Manifold.cusp_info>`).
      
    * Finding all :meth:`short_slopes <snappy.Manifold.short_slopes>`
      in disjoint embedded cusp neighborhoods.

  - The census :class:`HTLinkExteriors <snappy.HTLinkExteriors>` has
    been extented to 15 crossing knots (contributed by Malik
    Obeidin).

  - The census :class:`CensusKnots <snappy.CensusKnots>` has been
    extended to triangulations with 9 ideal tetrahedra.

  - Support for SageMath 9.0 and macOS Catalina.

  - Development moved to `GitHub <https://github.com/3-manifolds>`_.

* Version 2.7 (July 2019): New features include:

  - Python 3 is now recommended over Python 2 on all platforms; the
    default Mac and Windows apps use Python 3 rather than
    Python 2. The only difference most users will notice is that one
    must type ``print(blah)`` instead of ``print blah``.

  - :doc:`verify`: performance improvements by switching to the Krawczyk test.

  - Support for SageMath 8.8.

  - Installation instructions extensively updated.

  - GUI improvements, especially on macOS. These include improved
    support for dark mode and tabs on macOS Mojave and preliminary
    support for macOS Catalina.
