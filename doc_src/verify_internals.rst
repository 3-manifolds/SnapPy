Internals of verified computations
==================================



Naming
------

The names of methods containing ``check`` will raise an exception if the desired property
cannot be certified. There are different types of Exceptions to indicate how 
the certification failed. This type can be used by other methods to perform some
action such as changing the triangulation or increasing precision or to give up.

The user-facing methods have names starting with ``verify`` or ``verified`` and will fail more gracefully
returning ``False`` or ``None`` in such a case.



Generating certified shape intervals
------------------------------------

The recommeded way to obtain certified intervals for the shapes is via
``manifold.tetrahedra_shapes(intervals=True)`` as `described earlier
<verify.html>`_. Here we document the ``CertifiedShapesEngine`` used
internally to generate these intervals. It is of interest for those
users who want to understand the underlying interval math and
experiment with the Newton interval method.

Verification of hyperbolicity
-----------------------------

Methods containing ``check`` will raise an exception if the desired property
cannot be certified. Methods containing ``verify`` or ``verified`` will fail
more gracefully returning ``False`` or ``None`` in such a case.
