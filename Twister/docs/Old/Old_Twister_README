To get going with a quick example type:

g++ -o Puntorus twister.c puntorus.c -Wno-deprecated

at the command line in the directory containing the
mentioned files.  If everything compiles, type:

./Puntorus Ab > test.tri

The file test.tri should now contain a SnapPea
triangulation of the figure eight knot complement,
identical to the file fig8.tri (you can check this by
typing 'diff test.tri fig8.tri' at the command line).

The file heeg_fig8.c produces a different triangulation
of the figure eight knot complement, using a Heegard
splitting rather than specifying the monodromy of a
surface bundle.  To compile and run this program, type:

g++ -o Heeg_fig8 twister.c heeg_fig8.c -Wno-deprecated

./Heeg_fig8 > heeg_fig8.tri

to produce a file of size 47345 with checksum 541851980
(checked with the command 'cksum heeg_fig8.tri').

For a more detailed discussion of the code and how to use it, please
see the files "format_twister" and "sample.c".  Many other examples
are included.

Notes:
 - The -Wno-deprecated flag is to prevent gcc 4.0.1 from 
   complaining about the use of the deprecated library 
   iostream.h.
 - The function bundle_capoff() may eventually replace capoff().  The
   new version will communicate the natural longitude of the bundle to
   SnapPea.
