 *  terse_triangulation.h
 *
 *  This data structure describes a Triangulation in a "terse" format.
 *  The data structure is intended to minimize storage requirements,
 *  and contains only the minimum information required to reconstruct
 *  the Triangulation in the full triangulation.h format.
 *
 *  The data structure allows the option of including the value of the
 *  Chern-Simons invariant (mod 1/2).
 *
 *  Most often the TerseTriangulation will be used in conjunction with
 *  the TersestTriangulation data format (cf. tersest_triangulation.h),
 *  which represents the TerseTriangulation as a short sequence of
 *  characters, suitable for storage in a file or transmission over
 *  a network.
 *
 *  Bill Thurston provided the original idea for this data structure.
 *  The implementation has evolved from code written by Martin Hildebrand at
 *  the Geometry Center (then the Geometry Supercomputer Project) in 1988.
 *
 *
 *  [The following description of the TerseTriangulation assumes basic
 *  familiarity with the discussion "Gluings of ideal tetrahedra" preceding
 *  the Permutation typedef in kernel_typedefs.h.]
 *
 *  The TerseTriangulation data structure provides the data for an
 *  algorithm for constructing an ideal triangulation.  The algorithm is
 *  as follows.  We begin with n ideal tetrahedra, which we are going
 *  to assemble into an ideal triangulation.  The vertices of each
 *  tetrahedron are numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3, and the faces are numbered
 *  according to the opposite vertices.  The tetrahedra are all identical.
 *  Take one tetrahedron and call it tetrahedron 0.  Consider face 0
 *  of tetrahedron 0.  It may glue to some other face of tetrahedron 0,
 *  or it may glue to a different tetrahedron.  The first entry of the
 *  Boolean array glues_to_old_tet tells us which is the case.  That is,
 *  if glues_to_old_tet[0] is TRUE, then face 0 glues to some other face
 *  of tetrahedron 0;  if glues_to_old_tet[0] is FALSE, it glues to a
 *  different tetrahedron.
 *
 *  In the case that glues_to_old_tet[0] is TRUE, which_old_tet[0] will tell
 *  us which old tetrahedron it glues to (here which_old_tet[0] must
 *  obviously be 0, because tetrahedron 0 is the only tetrahedron we're
 *  working with so far, but in a minute you'll see the full generality of
 *  the which_old_tet array), and which_gluing[0] tells us the gluing
 *  pattern (cf. the discussion "Gluings of ideal tetrahedra" in
 *  kernel_prototypes.h).
 *
 *  In the case that glues_to_old_tet[0] is FALSE, we attach one of the
 *  as-yet-unused tetrahedra to face 0 of tetrahedron 0.  The new
 *  tetrahedron will be called tetrahedron 1, and its vertices will
 *  inherit indices from the vertices of tetrahedron 0 in the canonical
 *  way, by reflection across their common face.  (The gluing will be
 *  the identity Permutation.)
 *
 *  Once we've taken care of face 0 of tetrahedron 0, we move on to
 *  face 1 of tetrahedron 0.  If it's already been glued (to face 0),
 *  we do nothing.  Otherwise we consult the next entry in the
 *  glues_to_old_tet[] array:  if it's TRUE, then the next entries in
 *  the which_old_tet[] and which_gluing[] arrays tell us which tetrahedron
 *  it glues to (maybe tetrahedron 0, or maybe tetrahedron 1), and what
 *  the gluing Permutation is;  if it's FALSE, we attach a new tetrahedron
 *  as described above.
 *
 *  We continue this process for faces 2 and 3 of tetrahedron 0, then
 *  move on to faces 0, 1, 2 and 3 (in that order) of tetrahedron 1,
 *  then tetrahedron 2, etc., until we have constructed the entire
 *  triangulation.  Note that this algorithm assumes the triangulation
 *  is connected.
 *
 *  If there are n tetrahedra, there'll be 4n faces, and (4n)/2 = 2n
 *  decisions as to whether to glue to an old tetrahedron or a new one.
 *  (The last two "decisions" will always be to glue to an old tetrahedron,
 *  but we won't worry about that.  The terse string data format does,
 *  however, take this into account.)  Precisely (n - 1) of those
 *  decisions will be to add a new tetrahedron, and the remaining (n + 1)
 *  decisions will be to glue to an old tetrahedron.  This means that
 *  the glues_to_old_tet[] array must have length 2n, while the
 *  which_old_tet[] and which_gluing[] arrays must have length (n + 1).
 *
 *  The file SnapPea.h contains the "opaque typedef"
 *
 *      typedef struct TerseTriangulation   TerseTriangulation;
 *
 *  which lets the UI declare and pass pointers to TerseTriangulations
 *  without actually knowing what they are.    This file provides the
 *  kernel with the actual definition.
