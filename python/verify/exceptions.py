# A hierarchy of exceptions for the verify module
#
# All final excepions are deriving from a subclass
# * from a subclass of VerifyErrorBase to indicate whether a numerical or exact
#   verification failed
# * from a subclass of EquationType to indicate the type of equation of
#   inequality for which the verification failed.
#
# Intermediate subclasses (those without __init__) are not supposed to be
# raised.
#
# The hierarchy is as follows:
