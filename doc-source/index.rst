SnapPy is a user interface to the SnapPea kernel which runs on Mac OS
X, Linux, and Windows.  SnapPy combines a link editor and 3D-graphics
for Dirichlet domains and cusp neighborhoods with a powerful
command-line interface based on the `Python <http://python.org>`_
programming language. You can see it `in action <screenshots.html>`_,
learn how to `install <installing.html>`_ it, and read the `tutorial
<tutorial.html>`_.
