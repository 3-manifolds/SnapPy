 *  This file provides the following functions for creating and manipulating
 *  horospherical cross sections of a manifold's cusps, and computing the
 *  triangulation dual to the corresponding Ford complex.  These functions
 *  communicate with the UI by passing pointers to CuspNeighborhoods
 *  data structures;  but even though the UI may keep pointers to
 *  CuspNeighborhoods, the structure's internal details are private
 *  to this file.

 *  [Many other externally available functions are provided -- please see
 *  SnapPea.h for details.]
 *
 *  When the canonical cell decomposition dual to the Ford complex is not
 *  a triangulation, it is arbitrarily subdivided into tetrahedra.
 *
 *  Note:  This file uses the fields "displacement" and "displacement_exp"
 *  in the Cusp data structure to keep track of where the cusp cross
 *  sections are (details appear below).  Manifolds not under the care
 *  of a CuspNeighborhoods structure should keep the "displacement" set
 *  to 0 and the "displacement_exp" set to 1 at all times, so that
 *  canonical cell decompositions will be computed relative to cusps
 *  cross sections of equal volume.

/*
 *  Proposition 1.  The area of a horospherical cusp cross section is
 *  exactly twice the volume it contains.
 *
 *  Proof.  Do an integral in the upper half space model of hyperbolic
 *  3-space.  Consider a unit square in the horosphere z == 1, and calculate
 *  the volume lying above it as the integral of 1/z^3 dz from z = 1 to
 *  z = infinity.  QED
 *
 *  Comment.  This proposition relies on the hyperbolic manifold having
 *  curvature -1.  If the curvature had some other value, the proportionality
 *  constant would be something other than 2.
 *
 *  Comment.  The proportionality constant has units of 1 / distance.
 *  Normally, though, one doesn't have to think about units in hyperbolic
 *  geometry, because one uses the canonical ones.  I just wanted to make
 *  sure that nobody is bothered by the fact that we're specifying an area
 *  as twice a volume.
 *
 *  Comment.  We can measure the size of a cusp cross section by area or
 *  by volume.  The two measures are the same modulo a factor of two.
 *
 *
 *  Proposition 2.  If we choose a manifold's cusp cross sections to each
 *  have area (3/8)sqrt(3), then their interiors cannot overlap themselves
 *  or each other.
 *
 *  Proof.  By Lemma A below, we can choose a set of cusp cross sections
 *  with nonoverlapping interiors.  Advance each cusp cross section into
 *  the fat part of the manifold, until it bumps into itself or another
 *  cross section.  Look at the horoball packing as seen from a given cusp.
 *  Because the cusp is tangent to itself or some other cusp, there'll be
 *  a maximally large horoball.  If we draw the given cusp as the plane
 *  z == 1 in the upper half space model, the maximal horoball (and each of
 *  its translates) will appear as a sphere of diameter 1.  The view as
 *  seen from the given cusp therefore includes a packing of disjoint circles
 *  of diameter 1/2.  If it's a hexagonal packing the area of the cusp will
 *  equal the area of a hexagon of outradius 1/2, which works out to be
 *  (3/8)sqrt(3).  If it's not a hexagonal packing, the cusp's area will be
 *  even greater.  In the latter case, we retract the cusp cross section
 *  until its area is exactly (3/8)sqrt(3).  QED
 *
 *  Lemma A.  We can choose a set of cusp cross sections with nonoverlapping
 *  interiors.
 *
 *  Comment.  One expects the proof of this lemma to be completely trivial,
 *  but I don't think it is.
 *
 *  Proof #1.  Lemma A follows directly from the Margulis Lemma.  The
 *  required cusp cross sections are portions of the boundary of the thin
 *  part of the manifold.  QED
 *
 *  Proof #2.  Start with any decomposition of the manifold into positively
 *  oriented 3-cells.  For example, we could start with the canonical cell
 *  decomposition constructed in
 *
 *      J. Weeks, Convex hulls and isometries of cusped hyperbolic
 *          3-manifolds, Topology Appl. 52 (1993) 127-149.
 *
 *  Choose arbitrary cusp cross sections.  Retract each cusp as necessary
 *  so that its intersection with each 3-cell is "standard".  (I don't want
 *  to spend a lot of time fussing over the wording of this -- the idea is
 *  that the cross section shouldn't be so far forward that it has
 *  unnecessary intersections with other faces of the 3-cell.)  Then further
 *  retract each cusp cross section so that it doesn't intersect the other
 *  cross sections incident to the same 3-call.  This gives the nonoverlapping
 *  cross sections, as required.  QED
 *
 *
 *  Definition.  The "home position" of a cusp cross section is the one
 *  at which its area is (3/8)sqrt(3) and its enclosed volume is (3/16)sqrt(3).
 *
 *  By Proposition 2 above, when all the cusps are at their home positions,
 *  their interiors are disjoint.
 *
 *  The displacement field in the Cusp data structure measures how far
 *  a cusp cross section is from its home position.  The displacement is
 *  measured towards the fat part of the manifold, so a positive displacement
 *  means the cusp cross section is larger, and a negative displacement
 *  means it is smaller.
 *
 *  If we visualize a cusp's home position as a plane at height z == 1 in
 *  the upper half space model, then after a displacement d > 0 it will be
 *  at some height h < 1.  Set d equal to the integral of dz/z from z = h
 *  to z = 1 to obtain d = - log h, or h = exp(-d).  It follows that a cusp's
 *  linear dimensions vary as exp(d), while its area (and therefore its
 *  enclosed volume) vary as exp(2d).  The Cusp data structure stores the
 *  quantity exp(d) in its displacement_exp field, to avoid excessive
 *  recomputation.
 *
 *
 *  Definition.  The "reach" of a cusp is the distance from the cross
 *  section's home position to the position at which it first bumps into
 *  itself.
 *
 *  Note that the reach is half the distance from the cusp to itself,
 *  measured along the shortest homotopically nontrivial path.
 *  Proposition 2 implies that the reach of each cusp will be nonnegative.
 *
 *  Definition.  As a given cusp cross section moves forward into the
 *  fat part of the manifold, the first cusp cross section it bumps into
 *  is called its "stopper".  The displacement (measured from the home
 *  position) at which the given cusp meets its stopper is called the
 *  "stopping displacement".
 *
 *  Comment.  Unlike the reach, the stopper and the stopping displacement
 *  depend on the current displacements of all the cusps in the triangulation.
 *  They vary dynamically as the user moves the cusp cross sections.
 *
 *
 *  Sometimes the user may wish to change two or more cusp displacements
 *  in unison.  The Cusp's is_tied field supports this.  The displacements
 *  of "tied" cusps always stay the same -- when one changes they all do.
 *  The tie_group_reach keeps track of the reach of the tied cusps:
 *  it tells the displacement at which some cusp in the group first
 *  bumps into itself or some other cusp in the group.  Note that the
 *  tie_group_reach might be less than the stopping displacement of any
 *  of its constituent cusps;  this is because when a cusp moves forward
 *  its (ordinary) stopper stays still, but members of its tie group
 *  move towards it.

 *  Technical musings.
 *
 *  There are different approaches to maintaining a canonical
 *  triangulation as the cusp displacements change.
 *
 *  Low-level approach.
 *      Handle the 2-3 and 3-2 moves explicitly.  Calculate which
 *      move will be required next as the given cusp moves towards
 *      the requested displacement.
 *
 *  High-level approach.
 *      Set the requested cusp displacement directly, and call the
 *      standard proto_canonize() function to compute the corresponding
 *      canonical triangulation.
 *
 *  The low-level approach would be much more efficient at run time.
 *  The overhead of setting up the cusp cross sections at the beginning,
 *  and polishing the hyperbolic structure at the end, would be done
 *  only once.  It would also be efficient in that it tracks the convex
 *  hull (i.e. the canonical triangulation) precisely as the cusp moves
 *  toward the requested displacement.  (At each step it finds the next
 *  2-3 or 3-2 move which would be required as the cusp cross section
 *  moves continuously towards the requested displacement.)
 *
 *  The drawback of the low-level approach is that it would require
 *  a lot of low-level programming, which is time consuming, tends to
 *  make a mess, and can be error prone.  The high-level approach keeps
 *  the code cleaner, even though it's less efficient at run time.
 *
 *  For now I have implemented the high-level approach.  If it turns
 *  out that it is too slow, I can consider replacing it with the
 *  low-level approach.  An even better approach might be to make
 *  some simple changes to speed up the high-level approach.  For example,
 *  I was concerned that for large manifolds proto_canonize()'s bottleneck
 *  might be polishing the hyperbolic structure at the end.  I modified
 *  proto_canonize() to polish the hyperbolic structure iff the
 *  triangulation has been changed.

     *  you might except.  I recommend you make sketches for yourself as
     *  you read through the following.  (It's much simpler in pictures
     *  than it is in words.)
     *
     *  Proposition.  There is a unique common perpendicular to a pair of
     *  opposite edges of an ideal tetrahedron.
     *
     *  Proof.  Consider the line segment which minimizes the distance
     *  between the two opposite edges.  If it weren't perpendicular to
     *  each edge, then a shorter line segement could be found.  QED
     *
     *  Definition.  The "midpoint" of an edge of an ideal tetrahedron is
     *  the point where the edge intersects the unique common perpendicular
     *  to the opposite edge.
     *
     *  Proposition.  A half turn about the aforementioned unique common
     *  perpendicular is a symmetry of the ideal tetrahedron.
     *
     *  Proof.  It preserves (setwise) a pair of opposite edges.  Therefore
     *  it preserves (setwise) the tetrahedron's four ideal vertices, and
     *  therefore the whole tetrahedron.  QED
     *
     *  Proposition.  Consider a vertex cross section which passes through
     *  the midpoint of an edge.  The two sides of the vertex cross section
     *  which are incident to the given edge of the tetrahedron have lengths
     *  which are reciprocals of one another.
     *
     *  Proof.  Position the tetrahedron in the upper half space model so
     *  that the given edge is vertical and its midpoint is at height one.
     *
     *  Let P1 be the unique plane which contains the aforementioned unique
     *      common perpendicular and also contains the edge itself.
     *
     *  Let P2 be the unique plane which contains the aforementioned unique
     *      common perpendicular and is orthogonal to the edge itself.
     *
     *  Let S be the symmetry defined by a reflection in P1 followed by a
     *      reflection in P2.
     *
     *  S is equivalent to a half turn about the unique common perpendicular
     *  (proof:  P1 and P2 are orthogonal to each other, and both contain
     *  the unique common perpendicular).  Therefore S is a symmetry of the
     *  ideal tetrahedron, by the preceding proposition.
     *
     *  Let L1 and L2 be the lengths of the two sides of the vertex cross
     *  section which are incident to the given edge.  Because the vertex
     *  cross section is at height one in the upper half space model,
     *  L1 and L2 also represent the Euclidean lengths of two sides of the
     *  triangle obtained by projecting the ideal tetrahedron onto the
     *  plane z == 0 in the upper half space model.  Reflection in the
     *  plane P1 does not change the lengths of those two sides of the
     *  triangle, while reflection in the plane P2 (which, in Euclidean
     *  terms, is inversion in a hemisphere of radius one) sends each
     *  length to its inverse.  Since the composition S of the two
     *  reflections preserves the triangle, it follows that L1 and L2
     *  must be inverses of one another.  QED
     *
     *  If a vertex cross section passes through the midpoint of an edge,
     *  then the product of the lengths L1 and L2 (using the notation of
     *  the preceding proof) is L1 L2 = 1.  Now consider a vertex cross
     *  section which is a distance d away from the midpoint (towards
     *  the fat part of the manifold if d is positive, towards the cusp
     *  if d is negative).  According to the documentation at the top of
     *  this file, a cusp cross section's linear dimensions vary as exp(d),
     *  so the lengths of the corresponding sides of the new vertex cross
     *  section will be exp(d)L1 and exp(d)L2.  Their product is
     *  exp(d)L1 exp(d)L2 = exp(2d) L1 L2 = exp(2d).
     *
     *  If the lengths of the sides of the vertex cross section at the
     *  other end of the given edge are exp(d')L1 and exp(d')L2, then
     *  their product is exp(2d').  The product of all four lengths is
     *
     *      exp(d)L1 exp(d)L2 exp(d')L1 exp(d')L2 = exp(2(d + d')).
     *
     *  This is exactly what we need to know:  d + d' is the negative
     *  of the intercusp distance.  (Note that the midpoint has dropped
     *  out of the picture!)

     *  to translations in the covering transformation group (or the
     *  orientation preserving subgroup, in the case of a Klein bottle cusp).
     *  So we want an algorithm which uses only the local coordinates within
     *  each triangle, without requiring global consistency.
     *
     *  Imagine following a peripheral curve around the cusp cross section,
     *  and look at the sides of the triangles it passes through.  As we
     *  go along, we can keep track of the coordinates of the left and
     *  right hand edges.  When we "veer left" the left hand endpoint stays
     *  constant, while the right hand endpoint moves forward, and vice
     *  versa when we "veer right".  By adding up all the displacements to
     *  each endpoint, by the time we get back to our starting point we will
     *  have computed the total translation along the curve.  Actually,
     *  it suffices to compute the total displacement for only one endpoint
     *  (left or right) since both will give the same answer.
     *
     *  Finally, note that it doesn't matter in what order we sum the
     *  displacements.  We can just iterate through all tetrahedra in the
     *  triangulation without explicitly tracing curves.

     *  Face Horoballs
     *
     *      Face horoballs are horoballs which the given cusp sees across

     *      in the cusp triangulation provides an upper bound on the number
     *      of face horoballs.

     *  There are several ways we might find the location and size of
     *  the face horoballs.
     *
     *  (1) Use the TetShape to locate the center, and then use the
     *      lemma below to find the size.
     *
     *      This method is fairly efficient computationally, and lets
     *      us use the existing function compute_fourth_corner() from
     *      choose_generators.c.
     *
     *  (2) Ignore the TetShape, and rely entirely on the intercusp_distances
     *      to find both the location and size.
     *
     *      This method is conceptually straightforward.  Using the lemma
     *      below, one obtains three equations involving the location (x,y)
     *      and the height h of the face horoball.  The equations are
     *      quadratic in x and y, but they are monic, so subtracting
     *      equations gives linear dependencies between x, y and h.
     *      One can solve for x and y in terms of h, and obtain a quadratic
     *      equation to solve for h.  It's easy to prove that the lesser
     *      value of h will be the desired solution.  Confession:  I haven't
     *      actually worked out the equation for h.  It seems like it would
     *      be messy.
     *
     *  (3) Work in the Minkowski space model, and use linear algebra
     *      to compute the horoball as a vector on the light cone.
     *
     *      For background ideas, see
     *
     *          Weeks, Convex hulls and isometries of cusped hyperbolic
     *              3-manifolds, Topology Appl. 52 (1993) 127-149
     *      and
     *          Sakuma and Weeks, The generalized tilt formula,
     *              Geometriae Dedicata 55 (1995) 115-123.
     *
     *      The method might prove to be more-or-less equivalent to (2).
     *      By Lemma 4.2(c) of Weeks, the equation <u,v> = constant gives
     *      all the horospheres v a fixed distance from a horosphere u.
     *      So to find a horosphere a given distance from three given
     *      horospheres, one ends up intersecting three hyperplanes in
     *      E^(3,1) to get a line, and then intersecting the line with the
     *      upper light cone.  As in approach (2), the calculations are
     *      initially linear, but become quadratic at the end.  Again, I
     *      haven't worked through the details.
     *
     *  (4) Find a matrix in PSL(2,C) which takes an ideal tetrahedron
     *      in standard position to the desired ideal tetrahedron.
     *
     *      This is the approach used in snappea 1.3.  The formulas are
     *      simpler than you might expect.  The main disadvantage is that
     *      the 1.3 treatment applies only to orientable manifolds.  It
     *      might be possible to fix it up using MoebiusTransformations.
     *
     *  We use method (1), because it seems simplest.
     *
     *  Lemma.  Consider two horospheres of Euclidean height h1 and h2 (resp.)
     *  in the upper half space model of hyperbolic 3-space.  If the
     *  Euclidean distances between their centers (on the sphere at infinity)
     *  is c, then the hyperbolic distance d between the horospheres is
     *
     *                      d = log( c^2 / h1*h2 )
     *
     *  Proof.  Draw yourself a picture of the horospheres (or horocycles --
     *  a 2D cross sectional picture will serve just as well).  Label the
     *  distances h1, h2, c and d.  Now sketch a Euclidean hemisphere of
     *  radius c centered at the base of the first horosphere;  this is
     *  a plane in hyperbolic space.  Reflect the whole picture in this
     *  plane (in Euclidean terms, the reflection is an inversion in the
     *  hemisphere).  One of the horospheres gets taken to a horizontal
     *  Euclidean plane at height c^2/h1.  The other horosphere remains
     *  (setwise) invariant.  It is now obvious that the shortest distance
     *  from one horosphere to the other is along the vertical arc connecting
     *  them.  The distance is the integral of dz/z from h=h2 to h=c^2/h1,
     *  which works out to be log( c^2 / h1*h2 ).  QED
     *
     *  Comment.  We don't need it for the present code, but I can't
     *  resist pointing out that the above lemma has a nice intrinsic
     *  formulation, which doesn't rely on the upper half space model.
     *  Let H be the horosphere which appears as a horizontal plane z == 1
     *  in the upper half space model, and draw in the vertical geodesics
     *  connecting it to each of the two horospheres mentioned in the lemma.
     *  Let a = -log(h1) and b = -log(h2) be the respective distances from
     *  H to each of the old horospheres.  Interpret c as the distance along
     *  H from one of those segments to the other.  Now redraw the picture
     *  in, say, the Poincare ball model.  It'll be more symmetric now,
     *  since there's no longer a preferred "horosphere at infinity".
     *  You'll have an ideal triangle, with a horosphere at each vertex.
     *  The quantities a, b and d are the length of the shortest geodesics
     *  between horospheres, while c is the distance along a horosphere
     *  between two such geodesics.  The above lemma becomes
     *
     *  Lemma.  2 log c = d - a - b.
     *
     *  With better notation, namely a, b and c are the distances between
     *  cusp cross sections, and A, B and C are the distances along the
     *  cusps, the lemma becomes
     *
     *                  2 log A = a - b - c
     *                  2 log B = b - c - a
     *                  2 log C = c - a - b
     *
     *  Add two of those equations (say the first two) to get
     *
     *                  log AB = -c
     *
     *  As a special case, when c == 0, AB = 1.

     *  We want to find all horoballs of Euclidean height at least

     *  transformations of the cusp.  (We work with the double cover
     *  of Klein bottle cusps, so in effect all cusps are torus cusps.)
     *
     *  Let M' be H^3 / (Z + Z), where the Z + Z is the group of covering
     *  transformations of the cusp.  Visualize M' as a chimney in the
     *  upper half space model;  when its sides are glued together its
     *  parallelogram cross section becomes the torus cross section
     *  of the cusp.
     *
     *  Our plan is to lift ideal tetrahedra from the original manifold M
     *  to the chimney manifold M'.  We begin with the tetrahedra incident
     *  to the chimney's cusp (i.e. its top end), and then gradually tile
     *  our way downward.  Whenever a new tetrahedron introduces a new
     *  ideal vertex, we consider the horoball centered at that vertex.
     *  If its Euclidean height is greater than cutoff_height, we add it
     *  to a list.  Our challenge is to find an algorithm which does as
     *  little tiling as possible, yet still finds all horoballs higher
     *  than the cutoff_height.
     *
     *  The Naive Algorithm
     *
     *  The naive algorithm is to consider the neighbors of each tetrahedron
     *  already in the tiling.  If adding a neighbor would introduce no
     *  new vertices, add it.  If adding a neighbor would introduce a new
     *  vertex, add it iff the horoball at the new vertex is higher than
     *  the cutoff_height.
     *
     *  Unfortunately the naive algorithm fails.  The Whitehead link
     *  provides a counterexample.  Visualize the Whitehead link as an
     *  octahedron with faces identified.  The ideal vertices at the
     *  "north and south poles" form one cusp ("the red cusp") while the
     *  "equatorial ideal vertices" form the other cusp ("the blue cusp").
     *  Push the blue cusp cross section forward until it meets itself,
     *  but retract the red cusp cross section until it's tiny.  The
     *  canonical cell decomposition is a subdivision of the octahedron
     *  into two square pyramids (a "northern" and a "southern" one).
     *  SnapPea will, of course, arbitrarily subdivide each pyramid into
     *  two tetrahedra.  Now consider what happens when we apply the naive
     *  algorithm to this example, with the red cusp at infinity.  Each
     *  of the initial tetrahedra has a red vertex at infinity, and three
     *  blue vertices on the horizontal plane.  Its three neighbors to the
     *  sides are other tetrahedra of the same type (red at infinity and
     *  blue on the horizontal plane).  Its underneath neighbor shares the
     *  same three blue vetices, and introduce a new red vertex on the
     *  horizontal plane.  But because the red horoball is tiny, the naive
     *  algorithm will say not to add this tetrahedron.  So no new tetrahedra
     *  will be added, and the algorithm will terminate.  The naive
     *  algorithm has therefore failed, because it's missed blue horoballs
     *  of varying sizes.  (Assuming we've chosen the size of the tiny
     *  red cusp cross section to be small enough that the largest red
     *  horoballs are smaller than the medium sized blue one.)
     *
     *  The naive algorithm's failure was the bad news.  The good news
     *  is that if we take into account the varying sizes of the horoballs,
     *  the algorithm can be patched up and made to work.  First a few
     *  background lemmas.
     *
     *  Lemma 1.  For each horoball H, there is (a lift of) an edge
     *  of the canonical cell decompostion which connects H to some
     *  larger horoball H'.
     *
     *  Proof.  The horoball H is surrounded by (lifts of) 2-cells
     *  of the Ford complex.  Consider a 2-cell F which lies above some
     *  point of H (in the upper half space model).  F is dual to an edge
     *  of the canonical cell decomposition which connects H to some other
     *  horoball H'.  F lies above H, so by Lemma 2 below, H' is larger
     *  than H.  QED
     *
     *  Lemma 2.  Consider two horoballs H and H'.  If H' has a larger
     *  Euclidean height than H when viewed in some fixed way in the upper
     *  half space model of hyperbolic 3-space, then the plane P lying
     *  midway between them appears as a Euclidean hemisphere enclosing
     *  H and excluding H'.  In particular, every point of H is directly
     *  below some point of P, while no point of H' is.
     *
     *  Proof.  Draw the horoballs and construct P.  QED
     *
     *  Definition.  Two horoballs are "edge-connected" if (a lift of) an
     *  edge of the canonical cell decomposition connects one to the other.
     *
     *  Lemma 3.  Let H' be a horoball which is edge-connected to a smaller
     *  horoball H.  Then the Euclidean distance c between their centers
     *  (on the boundary plane of the upper half space model) is
     *
     *                   c = sqrt( a * b * exp(d) )
     *
     *  where
     *          a = Euclidean height of H'
     *          b = Euclidean height of H
     *          d = hyperbolic distance from H' to H.
     *
     *  Proof.  The lemma in get_quick_face_horoballs() says that
     *  d = log(c^2 / a*b).  Solve for c = sqrt( a * b * exp(d) ).  QED
     *
     *  Lemma 4.  Let H' be a horoball which is edge-connected to a smaller
     *  horoball H.  If the Euclidean height of H is at least cutoff_height,
     *  then the Euclidean distance c between the centers of H and H' is
     *  at least
     *              c >= sqrt( a * cutoff_height * exp(min_d) )
     *
     *  where a is the height of H' and min_d is the least distance from
     *  the horoball H' to any other horoball.
     *
     *  Proof.  Follows immediately from Lemma 3.
     *
     *  Comment.  The exp(min_d) factor makes H' act like a bigger horoball
     *  than it really is.  If you were to increase the cusp displacement
     *  by min_d, the height of H' would increase to a*exp(min_d).
     *
     *  Definition.  (A lift of) an edge of the canonical triangulation
     *  is "potentially useful" if one endpoint lies at the center of
     *  a horoball H' of height at least cutoff_height, and the distance
     *  between its two endpoints is at least c (as defined in Lemma 4).
     *  (As a special case, vertical edges (in the upper half space) are
     *  always "potentially useful".  The informal justification for this
     *  is that the horosphere at infinity is infinity large and its center
     *  is infinitely far away.)
     *
     *  Definition.  (A lift of) an ideal tetrahedron is "potentially useful"
     *  iff it contains at least one potentially useful edge.
     *
     *  The Corrected Algorithm
     *
     *  As before, begin with the tetrahedra incident to the chimney's cusp
     *  and gradually tile downward.  For each tetrahedron already in the
     *  tiling, consider its four neighbors and add those which are
     *  potentially useful.
     *
     *  Lemma 5.  Let H' be a horoball higher than the cutoff_height.
     *  If the Corrected Algorithm adds one potentially useful tetrahedron
     *  incident to H', then it adds them all.
     *
     *  Proof.  Look at the surface of the horoball H', which intrinsically
     *  is a Euclidean plane E.  An edge of the triangulation intersects
     *  the plane E in point P.  The edge is potentially useful iff P lies
     *  within a disk D (of intrinsic radius a/c in the Euclidean geometry
     *  of the horosphere E, but we don't need that fact).  A tetrahedron
     *  incident to H' is potentially useful iff it intersects the disk D.
     *  The set of all such tetrahedra forms a connected set (this follows
     *  from the path connectedness of the disk D).  Therefore if the
     *  algorithm adds one such tetrahedron, it will add them all.  QED
     *
     *  Proposition 6.  The Corrected Algorithm finds all horoballs higher
     *  than the cutoff_height.
     *
     *  Proof.  Let H be a horoball of maximal height (greater than the
     *  cutoff_height) which the algorithm missed.  By Lemma 1, there
     *  is a higher horoball H', and an edge connecting H' to H.  The
     *  edge is potentially useful, by Lemma 4 and the definition of a
     *  potentially useful edge.  By the assumed maximal height of H
     *  (among all horoballs which the Corrected Algorithm should have
     *  found but didn't), we know that the algorithm did find H', i.e.
     *  it added some potentially useful tetrahedron incident to the center
     *  of H'.  By Lemma 5, it must have added all potentially useful
     *  tetrahedra incident to H', and therefore must have found H.  QED
     *
     *  Corollary 7.  We can refine the Corrected Algorithm as follows.
     *  For each tetrahedron T already added, we consider only those
     *  neighbors T' incident to a face of T which contains at least
     *  one potentially useful edge.
     *
     *  Proof.  The proof of Proposition 6 still works.  QED
