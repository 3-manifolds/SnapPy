SnapPy
======

SnapPy is a package for studying the topology and geometry of
3-manifolds, with a focus on hyperbolic structures.  It is based on
the SnapPea kernel written by `Jeffery Weeks
<http://www.geometrygames.org>`_.  

Complete documentation is available on the web including the `main
page <http://snappy.computop.org>`_ and an `installation guide
<http://snappy.computop.org/installing.html>`_.  You can also browse
the `source code <https://bitbucket.org/t3m/snappy>`_.
