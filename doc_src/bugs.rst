.. Reporting bugs and other problems

Reporting bugs and other problems
=================================

We very much welcome reports of any difficulties you encounter
installing or using SnapPy. While we do significant testing before
each release, with so many supported platforms/configurations and only
three core developers, we need your help to keep things running
smoothly. To report a problem, you may either `open a formal issue
ticket <https://bitbucket.org/t3m/snappy/issues/>`_ or `write to the
developers <snappy-help@computop.org>`_. As always, it is most helpful
if you include the details of your computer's configuration as well as
verbatim copies of any error messages.
