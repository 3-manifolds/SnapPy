This directory contains data files which have been removed
from the snappy manifolds directory.  They were used to
construct the original manifolds.sqlite file, using the now
obsolete SnapPy iterators:

OrientableCuspedCensus
OrientableClosedCensus
NonorientableCuspedCensus
NonorientableClosedCensus
LinkExteriors
CensusKnots

These have now been replaced by new iterators which are loaded from
the module snappy.database.  The code for the obsolete iterators
remains in SnapPy.pyx (with some changes to make them independent of
the database, and with Obs preprended to the name).

The script make_db.py will rebuild the manifolds.sqlite database file
using the data stored in this directory.  This works even if
manifolds.sqlite is removed from snappy/manifolds.
