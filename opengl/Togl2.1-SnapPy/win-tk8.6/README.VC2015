Here are the steps for building Togl for Tk8.6 using the VS2015
Community Edition.

First you need to install Glew as follows, using an administrator
command prompt.

set VCPATH "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC"
copy glew\bin\Release\x64\glew32.dll C:\Windows\System32\
copy glew\bin\Release\Win32\glew32.dll C:\Windows\SysWOW64\
copy glew\lib\Release\x64\glew32.lib %VCPATH%\lib\amd64
copy glew\lib\Release\Win32\glew32.lib %VCPATH%\lib
copy glew\include\GL\glew.h %VCPATH%\include\GL
copy glew\include\GL\wglew.h %VCPATH%\include\GL

VS 2015 provides several command prompts with preset environments.
Use "VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" for 64-bit builds and
"VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt" for 32-bit builds.

The build commands, depending on the architechture, are

nmake -f makefile.vc MACHINE=X86 TCLDIR=tcltk
nmake -f makefile.vc MACHINE=AMD64 TCLDIR=tcltk64

Don't forget to enjoy the way that Microsoft names things.  The
directory for 64 bit shared libraries is System32 while the
32 bit shared libraries go in SysWOW64.  The 64 bit CPU is named
x64 while the 32 bit CPU is named x86.
