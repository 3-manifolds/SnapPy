"""This module provides the classes NewtonShapeCertifer and KrawczyShapeCertifer.
These classes are instantiated with a Manifold and a precision specification,
given in binary or decimal digits with the options bit_prec or dec_prec.  They
produce a set of "certified" tetrahedra shapes.  This means that it can be
proven that there exists a solution to the Manifold's gluing equations which
is contained in an interval vector centered at the certified shapes and having
radius 2^-p + 2^-pj where p is the specified binary precision.

The certification involves first using Newton's method to compute a set Z0 of
tetrahedron shapes for M to a "working precision" higher than the precision
being certified.  The working precision may be provided explicitly with the
working_prec option.  If not provided it will be determined automatically.

We then consider the interval vector Z centered at Z0 with radius
2^-p + 2^-pj. We verify that Z contains a solution to the gluing equations.
Actually, we certify that Z contains a solution to the logarithmic gluing
equations, obtained by taking the log of both sides of the gluing equations.
This is because the logarithmic derivative of the rational function on the
left hand side of a gluing equation is a linear expression in log(z_i) and
log(z_i - 1) with small integer coefficients, making it very convenient to
work with.

The criteria used to show that Z contains a solution are given
by [XXX LOOKUP PUBLISHED REFERENCES].
