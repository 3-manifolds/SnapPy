To Do List
==========

- For a more current list, see the GitHub `issues list
  <https://github.com/3-manifolds/SnapPy/issues>`_.

- GUI
  
  - Allow you to get the info (position, radius) of a horoball by clicking it.  

- Documentation

  - More hyperlinks

  - Expand tutorial 

  - Make more screencasts

- snappy 
  
- Kernel 

- Minor 

  - dual_curves should really cache its result and have this used by
    drill
  
  - One should be able to convert a SymmetryGroup to a Sage permutation group.   

  - Also, the SymmetryGroup presentation function should be wrapped.
    There is code for this in the old SnapPeaPython.  

- Ambitious

  - A new basic (sub)class: S3Knot (and/or S3Link).
 
  - Consider adding a HeegaardSplitting class 

  - Consider merging our t3m project and normal surface code into
    SnapPy. 

  - Redo much of Snap in the context of Sage/SnapPy.   

     - Add a method for computing tetrahedron shapes to arbitrary precision.

     - Add methods for computing invariant trace fields and related number
       fields.
