\frametitle{Hyperbolic $3$-Space}
Hyperbolic $3$-space $\HH^3$ is the unique homogeneous Riemannian
$3$-manifold with all sectional curvatures equal to
$-1$. Alternatively, $\HH^3 = PSL_2(\CC)/SO(3)$ with a normalized invariant metric.

There is a natural compactification
$\Hbar^3 \dot=\,\, \HH^3 \sqcup S^2_\infty$ which is homeomorphic
to a $3$-ball.  The boundary $S^2_\infty$ is the {\it sphere at
  infinity}.  It has a canonical conformal structure.

\pause
There are $8$ simply-connected Riemannian $3$-manifolds whose
full isometry group acts transitively with compact point stabilizers,
and which admit a compact quotient under the action of some discrete
torsion free group of isometries.  These are the ``geometries'' in
Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, proved by Grisha Perelman in
2003.

{\large An ideal tetrahedron in the upper half-space:}
\vskip 10pt
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=.6\textheight]{labeledtet.png}}
This tetrahedron is the convex hull of the points $0$, $\infty$, $1$, $z$.
Up to isometry, every ideal tetrahedron has this form.

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Hyperbolic $3$-Space: {\it Convex hulls}}
The closure in $\Hbar^3$ of a plane in $\HH^3$ is a $2$-disk whose
boundary is a geometric circle on $S^2_\infty$. Call this an extended plane.
\pause

Each extended plane in $\Hbar^3$ divides
$\Hbar^3$ into two closed half-spaces which meet along the extended
plane.  The {\it convex hull} of a subset $X$ of $\Hbar^3$ is the
intersection of all half-spaces containing $X$.  \pause

An {\it ideal tetrahedron} is the convex hull of four points on
$S^2_\infty$.  Every ideal tetrahedron has three symmetries which
interchange two pairs of opposite edges and reflect the other two
edges.
\pause

The cross-ratio of the vertices of an {\it ordered} ideal tetrahedron
is invariant under {\it order-preserving } isometries.  Take an ordered
tetrahedron $\Delta$ with cross-ratio $z$ and apply an order $2$ symmetry.
The new ordered tetrahedron will have cross-ratio $z$, $\frac{1}{1-z}$,
or $\frac{z-1}{z}$.
\pause

Remark: The boundary of the convex hull of any closed subset of
$S^2_\infty$ is a {\it pleated surface} bent along a {\it geodesic
  lamination}.

\frametitle{Hyperbolic $3$-Space: {\it Shapes}}

The {\it shape} of an ideal tetrahedron assigns complex numbers
to the edges in the following pattern.

If an ordered tetrahedron $\Delta = (v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is translated to
$(0, 1, \infty, z)$, then the shape assigns $z$ to the edge $v_0$ -- $v1$.
When $\operatorname{Im}(z)>0$ say that $\Delta$ is {\it positively oriented}. 
\pause

If tetrahedra $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n$ fit around an edge as shown, and
the shape values for that edge are $z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n$, then
$z_1 \cdots z_n = 1$.

\frametitle{Hyperbolic $3$-Space: {\it Volumes}}

Consider a co-compact discrete group $\Gamma$ of Euclidean translations of
$\RR^2$ with fundamental domain a parallelogram $P$.  The action extends
to an action by translations on $\RR^3$, which are isometries of the
upper half-space model.
\pause

The region $D$ = $P\times [1,\infty)$ is a fundamental domain for the action
of $\Gamma$ on $\RR^2\times [1,\infty)$.  The quotient is diffeomorphic to
$T^2\times[1,\infty)$ and inherits a complete hyperbolic metric.
The hyperbolic manifold, $D/\Gamma$ is called a {\it cusp neighborhood}.
A simple computation, using $dV_{\text{Hyp}} = \frac{1}{t^3}dV_{\text{Euc}}$, shows
that cusp neighborhoods have finite volume.
\pause

A $3$-manifold $M$ with a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume
is either compact or has finitely many ends, each isometric to a
cusp neighborhood.  Thus $M$ is diffeomorphic to the interior of a
compact $3$-manifold with torus boundary components.

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Geometrization}
A $3$-manifold $M$ has a {\it geometric structure} if
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $M$ arises as the quotient of one of the $8$
  geometries by a discrete torsion-free group of isometries.
\item[$\bullet$] The induced Riemannian metric on $M$ is complete.
\end{itemize}
\pause
Every $3$-manifold is a connected sum of {\it irreducible} $3$-manifolds
which cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial connected sum.
 
\pause
The Geometrization Conjecture asserts that every compact irreducible
$3$-manifold with (possibly empty) torus boundary can be cut along
a canonical family of tori to produce (open) geometric manifolds.

\pause
For the $7$ non-hyperbolic geometries, the geometric manifolds
have been classified.

\pause
A finite volume hyperbolic $3$-manifold has a {\it unique} hyberbolic
structure by Mostow-Prasad rigidity.  So geometric invariants are
topological invariants. \pause (!!!!) 
\medskip
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Computation}
SnapPy's data structure for representing a $3$-manifold $M$ contains:

An {\it ideal triangulation}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] A pseudo-manifold $K$ constructed by identifying pairs of
  faces of finitely many tetrahedra so that every vertex link is either
  a sphere or a torus.  (To recover $M$, take the realization and
  delete the vertices with torus links.)
\item[$\bullet$] A complex shape parameter assigned to one edge of
  each tetrahedron. (The parameters for the other edges are determined.)
\end{itemize}
\pause
The shapes satisfy the {\it gluing equations}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$]For each equivalence class $e$ of edges, the product
  of the shapes assigned to the edges in $e$ equals $e^{2\pi i}$.
\end{itemize}
These equations have the simple form:
$$z_1^{a_1}(1-z_1)^{b_1} \cdots z_k^{a_k}(1-z_k)^{b_k} = c = \pm 1$$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Solving the gluing equations} 

The complex dimension of the space of solutions to the gluing
equations is equal to the number of cusps.  Adding a ``completeness
equation'' for each cusp cuts the dimension down to $0$, giving
finitely many solutions.
\pause

{\it In practice}, if the manifold has a hyperbolic structure then it
will be described by one of these finitely many solutions.  This means
that $M = \HH^3/\Gamma$ and there is a $\Gamma$-invariant tiling of
$\HH^3$ by tetrahedra of the specified shapes.
\pause

{\it In practice}, starting with all regular ideal tetrahedra,
Newton's method converges extremely quickly to the hyperbolic structure
(if one exists, as almost always happens).
\pause

Here is a plot of times required for computing hyperbolic structures
on knot complements, against the number of crossings in the knot diagram.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Dehn filling} 
Without the completeness equations, solutions to the gluing equations
near the hyperbolic structure correspond to {\it incomplete} hyperbolic
structures.
\pause

Under certain conditions, the completion of one of these incomplete
metrics adds exactly a circle of points at the end of a cusp,
producing a hyperbolic manifold with different topology.
\pause

The topological operation, called {\it Dehn filling}, is: add a
boundary torus and then glue $S^1\times D^2$ to the new boundary
component.  The topology of the result is determined by the homotopy
class of the curve $\{*\}\times \partial D^2$ in the torus.  \pause

All but finitely many dehn fillings of a cusp yield a hyperbolic
manifold.  Finding the hyperbolic structure involves adding a {\it
  filling equation} instead of the completeness equation for the cusp.
Again, {\it in practice} Newton's method is amazingly effective.
