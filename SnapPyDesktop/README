To make the SnapPy application launchable from a Linux desktop, the
files in the share directory can be installed either in $HOME/.local/share
or in /usr/share.

The files consist of a .desktop file and icon files of various sizes in
.png format.  The .desktop file is used by the window manager uses to
recognize SnapPy as an application, and to know how to launch it.
