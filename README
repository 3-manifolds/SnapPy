* SnapPy: A Python interface for Jeff Weeks' SnapPea
*
* by Marc Culler < http://math.uic.edu/~culler > and Nathan Dunfield < http://dunfield.info >
* 
* Distributed from < http://math.uic.edu/~t3m >

* Installation Instructions
-------------------------

This distribution requires Python 2.2 or newer.  The software is for
Unix-style systems (e.g. Linux/Solaris/*BSD/MacOS X), and should also work
on Windows using the Unix toolkit Cygwin. We have not tested it on
Windows (sans Cygwin) or MacOS 9.

If you have superuser privileges on your UNIX system:

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

This will install SnapPeaPython in the site-packages directory of your
python installation.

If are not a superuser and wish to install SnapPeaPython in your home directory:

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install --install-lib ~

This will create a subdirectory of your home directory named SnapPea
containing the package.  In order for python to find the package you
must add this directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.  For
example in bash:

export PYTHONPATH=~

* SAGE
--------------------

SnapPy can also be used as a module of SAGE <http:www.sagemath.org> in
which case it picks up some nice additional features.  To install it
for SAGE do

  sage -python setup.py installl

* Documentation
-------------------------

At the moment, the best way to see what's there is to use the IPython
interpreter (or the SAGE interpreter) and introspection and
tab-completion.   

For instance, to see what's available, do:

In [2]: import SnapPy

In [3]: SnapPy.<hit tab-key>
...
SnapPy.Manifold
...

# You'll see the main Manifold class above as well as some census.  Now,
# how do you specify a manifold?

In [4]: SnapPy.Manifold? <hit return-key>
...instructions for creating a manifold...

# So now we create a manifold

In [5]: M = SnapPy.Manifold("m004")

# What can we do with it?  

In [6]: M.<hit tab-key>
...list of methods...

#What does the "cover" method do?

In [7]: M.cover?
...description of cover method..
