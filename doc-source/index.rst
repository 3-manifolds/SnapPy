SnapPy is a program for studying the topology and geometry of
3-manifolds, with a focus on hyperbolic structures.  
It runs on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows, and combines a link editor and 3D-graphics
for Dirichlet domains and cusp neighborhoods with a powerful
command-line interface based on the `Python <http://python.org>`_
programming language. You can see it `in action <screenshots.html>`_,
learn how to `install <installing.html>`_ it, and read the `tutorial
<tutorial.html>`_.   

News
============

Version 1.5, released in February 2012; includes improved manifold
censuses, here are `some examples <censuses.html>`_.  
Version 1.4, released in December 2011, uses the current release of
IPython, which has been completely rewritten.
Version 1.3 was released in February 2011 and has a completely
redesigned cusp horoball viewer and many bug fixes!  Version 1.3.10 of
