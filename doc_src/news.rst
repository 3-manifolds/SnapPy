* Version 2.8 (May 2020): New features include:

  - Raytraced interior views of a hyperbolic 3-manifold via the 
    :meth:`inside_view <snappy.Manifold.inside_view>` method, see also
    `images <https://im.icerm.brown.edu/portfolio/snappy-views/>`_ and
    `demo video <https://youtu.be/CAERhmUCkRs>`_.

  - :doc:`verify`: Several new features:

    * Complex volume (and thus the Chern-Simons invariant) for both
      cusped and closed manifolds, see
      :meth:`complex_volume <snappy.Manifold.complex_volume>`.
      
    * Disjoint cusp neighborhoods by the method :meth:`cusp_areas
      <snappy.Manifold.cusp_areas>` which uses
      :meth:`cusp_area_matrix <snappy.Manifold.cusp_area_matrix>`.

    * Cusp shapes (see :meth:`cusp_info <snappy.Manifold.cusp_info>`).
      
    * Finding all :meth:`short_slopes <snappy.Manifold.short_slopes>`
      in disjoint embedded cusp neighborhoods.

  - The census :class:`HTLinkExteriors <snappy.HTLinkExteriors>` has
    been extented to 15 crossing knots (contributed by Malik
    Obeidin).

  - The census :class:`CensusKnots <snappy.CensusKnots>` has been
    extended to triangulations with 9 ideal tetrahedra.

  - Support for SageMath 9.0 and macOS Catalina.

  - Development moved to `GitHub <https://github.com/3-manifolds>`_.

* Version 2.7 (July 2019): New features include:

  - Python 3 is now recommended over Python 2 on all platforms; the
    default Mac and Windows apps use Python 3 rather than
    Python 2. The only difference most users will notice is that one
    must type ``print(blah)`` instead of ``print blah``.

  - `Verified computations <verify.html>`_: performance improvements
    by switching to the Krawczyk test.

  - Support for SageMath 8.8.

  - Installation instructions extensively updated.

  - GUI improvements, especially on macOS. These include improved
    support for dark mode and tabs on macOS Mojave and preliminary
    support for macOS Catalina.
    
* Version 2.6.1 (August 2018): New features include:

  - Support for SageMath 8.3, Python 3.7, and macOS Mojave.

  - Computing `ideals defining SL(2, C) character varieties.
    <additional_classes.html#snappy.HolonomyGroup.character_variety_vars_and_polys>`_
    Contributed by Jean-Philippe Burelle, based on `this paper
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08241>`_.

  - Many bug fixes. 

* Version 2.6 (Nov 2017): New features include:

  - STL export of Dirichlet domains for 3D printing, contributed by
    Jose Sanchez.

  - Support for Python 3, SageMath 7.5, 7.6, and 8.0, and many more 
    versions of Python on Windows.

  - Much improved infrastructure for testing and distributing SnapPy.

* Version 2.4 (May 2016): New features include:

  - Added `census of Platonic manifolds <platonic_census.html>`_. 

  - Rigorous computation of `cusp translations <manifold.html#snappy.Manifold.cusp_translations>`_.  
  
  - Added decorations to `triangulation isomorphism signatures
    <manifold.html#snappy.Manifold.triangulation_isosig>`_ for
    encoding peripheral curves.
    
  - Faster verification of non-tetrahedral canonical cell decompositions.
  
  - Improvements to the `link and planar diagram component
    <spherogram.html>`_, mostly contributed by Malik Obeidin, include:

    * Bar-Natan's super-fast `tangle-based algorithm
      <http://www.math.toronto.edu/drorbn/Talks/Aarhus-1507/>`_ for
      computing the Alexander polynomial.

    * Can now compute the `Seifert matrix
      <spherogram.html#spherogram.Link.seifert_matrix>`_ and express a
      link as a `braid closure <spherogram.html#spherogram.Link.braid_word>`_.

    * Conversion to/from `SageMath links and braids
      <spherogram.html#spherogram.Link.sage_link>`_.

    * Many under-the-hood improvements.  
    
  - New Windows installer. 

* Version 2.3 (March 2015):  New features include:

  - Major improvements to the `link and planar diagram component
    <spherogram.html>`_, including link simplification, random links,
    and better documentation.

  - Basic support for `spun normal surfaces
    <manifold.html#snappy.Manifold.normal_boundary_slopes>`_.

  - New extra features when used inside of Sage:

    * HIKMOT-style `rigorous verification of hyperbolic structures
      <verify.html>`_, 
      contributed by Matthias Goerner.  
      
    * Many `basic knot/link invariants
      <spherogram.html#the-link-class>`_, contributed by Robert
      Lipschitz and Jennet Dickinson.
