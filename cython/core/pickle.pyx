# Cython functions for pickling and unpickling Triangulations
#
# The functions pickle_triangulation and unpickle triangulation
# perform fairly straightforward serialization and deserialization of
# the kernel's TriangulationData structure, via Python bytes objects.
#
# For complete orientable manifolds, this process preserves all
# combinatorial properties of the triangulation, including the
# orderings of the tetrahedra and of the vertices in each tetrahedron
# as well as the normal curve description of the peripheral curves.
# (The peripheral curves are not preserved for manifolds which are not
# orientable or not complete.)
#
# These functions are limited to manifolds with at most 255 cusps
# such that the normal coordinates for the peripheral curves are assumed
# to be in the interval [-128, 127].  Also the Dehn filling coefficients
# must be integers in that interval.  If these conditions do not hold
# then the _to_string method can be used as an alternative. 
#
# Note that the byte sequences produced by pickle_triangulation
# are very likely to contain null bytes, so care must be taken
# in the code when converting between Python and C strings.

# Used to test if a double has an integer value:
